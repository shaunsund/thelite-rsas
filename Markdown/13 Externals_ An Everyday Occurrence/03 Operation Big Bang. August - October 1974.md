ZIPRA had learnt the folly of large-scale incursions the hard way and had now adopted a much more devious method of waging war.
The early tactic of infiltrating 100 men at a time had proved a fateful lesson. The security forces had hunted them down and wiped them out virtually to a man.
Now, instead of sending large groups across to get massacred, ZIPRA had decided to build up an internal network of arms caches and subversive cells.
Operating clandestinely from Francistown in northern Botswana, Russian-trained agents were planning to set up a long chain of arms caches’ throughout the Matabeleland Tribal Trust Lands with the help of an internal network of ZIPRA sympathizers. The scheme was called the 3·2·3 network and the idea was that, when the time was right, the locals were to ferry ammunition to the arms caches for the terrorists. The network was also responsible for recruiting men for terror training.
ZIPRA had planned it all very carefully. They had devised a series of secret signals to enable one person to recognise the next in the chain. It was a cut-out network so that if one man was picked by the security forces he could not pinpoint the others.
But Rhodesian Special Branch officers were clever too and acting on some exceptionally good intelligence. they were able to capture a Russian-trained agent in Bulawayo, pick-up all the key people and smash the network. They also located all the holes dug in the TTLs to receive the ammunition.
The SAS, meanwhile, had been called in to pinpoint ZIPRA camps in south-west Zambia, after incursions effected from one end of Lake Kariba to the other.
Documents captured on the Pondoland East “B” camp attack told of another camp a day’s walk to the west That would have placed the new camp in the area of the Ngwemanzi River some 11 kilometres (seven miles) inland ... and due north of the subversive and recruiting cells set up in Wankie TTL. Aerial reconnaissance was able to pick up the camp, and photographic interpreters felt there could be as many as twenty people in it. Special Branch sources considered that the camp could well be the headquarters of a number of ZIPRA satellite camps.
Lieutenant Chris Schellenberg, who had pinpointed Pondoland “B” camp. was tasked to lead in another reconnaissance team to establish if the Ngwemanzi River camp was still occupied. If it was, then the SAS planned to attack it.
At 20h00 on August 9, Schulie and his team of Corporal John Ross, Lance Corporal Mac Mcintosh and Trooper Jo Bresler, dressed in terrorist kit and with AK rifles, crossed unseen over the invisible border to the Zambian bank at a point downstream of Victoria Falls.
Within minutes the ferry party, having deposited the team, pushed off again for the southern shore.
The moon was not yet up as the reconnaissance team crept passed the fires of unsuspecting Zambian fishermen. Then they left the fishermen far behind and headed north into the night ... and for some eight kilometres (five miles). they cautiously moved through the rugged, broken countryside, inhabited only by game.
Slowly, conscientiously, they eased their way into the Zambian hinterland … lying up ... listening for gun shots, the sounds of wood being chopped … looking for smoke ... checking for spoor ...
After a couple of nights, five shots rang out across the bush. It was the first indication of a terrorist presence. The locals would not be using high-powered rifles. The terrorists were obviously making use of their rifles to bag something for their cooking pots.
The four SAS men moved in closer to the area of the suspected camp.
As they lay up that day they heard the strangely out-of-place rumble of a vehicle in the distance. Then they saw a green truck travelling westwards. It was similar to a Rhodesian Army Land-Rover but had a longer bonnet.
Now they were on to something…
What was a vehicle doing in this rugged primitive countryside in the middle of nowhere? It was not between two towns or villages ... there were no places of interest marked on the maps ... and the local Africans did not use vehicles.
Certainly the sight of any vehicle would have been immediately suspicious. but the fact that this was a _military_-styled one confirmed their theories that this was no civilian vehicle.
It could only be a terrorist vehicle - and it had to be going to the same place they were heading.
Briefing John Ross and Jo Bresler to wait behind for them, Schulie and Mac Mclntosh moved forwards to try and pinpoint the camp.
They had gone only one kilometre when three shots from a terrorist weapon rang out across the countryside. John and Jo, thinking the others had been shot or compromised. followed their orders for such an event and returned to their pre-arranged rendezvous point The shots had come nowhere near them in fact. but due to a communications problem. Schulie was unable to let the others know ... and John and Jo continued 10 follow SAS emergency procedures and crossed back into Rhodesia next day.
The other half of the reconnaissance team meanwhile had located the camp and were keeping it under surveillance.
Shortly after midnight, Schulie and Mac slunk into the camp which straddled the river. There was not a single person to be seen. The stark framework of a hut which stood silhouetted against the moonlight was proof that the terrorists had abandoned the base several nights before.
A few Russian matchbox wrappers lying around what had once been the main fireplace. bits of scrap paper with Russian writing on them. and the seldom-seen early-warning device of tins threaded on string, was the only evidence they found that ZIPRA had been there.
There was no sign of the green truck. They could find no tracks. They had not seen it move. So where the hell had it gone?
They skirted the camp searching for the tracks then struck out for high ground to check the road where they had seen the truck. It was then they saw a new road leading off the old one and going eastwards. It ran alongside an old rutted bicycle path and had been made by simply by-passing the bigger trees and demolishing the smaller bushes in the drive to get access to the east
On investigation, they found tracks which could only have come from that elusive truck.
It was obviously a route which needed further investigation. They felt that the truck had to be going to a ZIPRA camp, probably the one that replaced the abandoned base. Having obtained the blessing of Garth Barren back in the SAS base, they decided to follow it to its logical conclusion.
Slowly, cautiously, they picked their way eastwards over the flattened grass of the new track. Thinking that they might bump into the re-sited terrorist camp at any moment, they removed their boots to aid their stealthy approach.
They lay up next day and that night were back on their travels. As they headed eastwards they suddenly heard the sound of men’s voices and went to ground.
They took out the nightscope for a quick look; saw the glow of a fire and four African men sitting around it talking. To get a closerlook they put down their packs and moved forward.
Then, the nightsight slipped from Mac’s hands with a thud. For a moment the two soldiers hardly dared breathe as they lay low in the shadows.
An African got up and wandered out to investigate. He shone his torch towards them but they hugged the ground and were far enough away not to be seen.
The man lingered only a minute, anxious to return to the warmth of the fire and the companionship of his mates. Convincing himself that there was no one out there, he snapped off his torch and hurried back to his friends.
Quickly. Schulie and Mac left. skirting the area looking for tracks Orsome indication that this was a terrorist camp. But there was no sign; it was merely a temporary resting place.
But where was the base? Where had that truck gone? Obviously it had to be further east.
They moved off once more and set up an observation post on a hill overlooking the track. Next day they saw several ZIPRA cycling towards the area where they suspected the base to be and heard shots coming from the same direction.
Again they moved on, confident of finding the camp at the end of the track.
They had now been in Zambia far longer that was normal at that stage in the war. By remaining to exploit the possibilities for a couple of days longer, they had overstayed their visit. While Garth Barrett had given his blessing. CIO had net, and on their next radio communication with Barrett, they were told to return to base as soon as possible.
It would mean pulling out without having found the camp. But orders were orders and they had no choice. Within three weeks. Schulie was back in the same area. This time. Captain Mick Graham and Sergeant Bob McKenna were with him.
Their mission this time was to check if the spot where the four men had been chat-
ting around the camp fire was still occupied. They also had to find a camp east of the Mazanga River – the one the first reconnaissance team might have discovered had they been allowed to continue eastwards along the road. They further had to check out a suspicious looking hole picked up by aerial photography.
Again they spent several days quietly easing into the area. lying up, listening, searching. and all the time working their way towards the place where Schulie and Mac had seen the four men around the camp fire.
They found no signs that anyone had been there lately; they then retraced their steps, followed a footpath leading off the main track that ran down to a river. The terrorists would need water; maybe they would find the camp somewhere nearby?
They crossed the river hut still found nothing of interest. Time was going. It was already becoming daylight. They had only limited rations for their visit and would have to return to Rhodesia soon.
Schulie realised it had been a mistake to take this route. The elusive camp had to be way in the distance somewhere. And he hadn’t a clue how to get there either.
He told his two companions of his dilemma, then, leaving them in a little gully looking after his pack, he wandered off alone with his rifle.
He moved cautiously around the area, searching the countryside for a clue, no matter how small, that might point him towards the enemy base.
Then he heard sounds of village activity and saw large herds of goats and cattle grazing along the Mazanga River. Occasionally. the excited shouts of the herdboys rang across the countryside as they scolded their charges.
At night, Schulie moved in closer. It was Saturday and just after last light. a beer drink got underway. A gramophone, drums and a whistle. ably assisted by the barking of dogs. Provided music throughout the long night. It was clearly a civilian complex; yet what of those suspicious-looking boot tracks Schulie had seen on and off the paths at each end of the village? During the early morning, he heard the distinctive sound of a vehicle to the north, and, remembering the truck from the first reconnaissance, he moved to investigate, and halted on high ground. Below. about a kilometre away. a green truck was moving. It was bigger than the first he had seen three weeks earlier, being about a four-tanner.
He saw a couple of men offloading kit then the truck was driven under the trees and screened from view.
All the activity was taking place near a large hole ... obviously the one picked up on the aerial photographic run, and the one they had been tasked to investigate.
It had to be a civilian road construction gang at work.. Still he would check it out and confirm it just the same.
It was broad daylight now and Schulie eased right down to where the activity was taking place. He crawled among the long grass, carefully creeping towards the noises.
The grass was long but not long enough to afford him cover if he stood up. and he lay low in a hole underneath a clump of small palms, right on the edge of the river junction.
He was 150 metres from three unarmed Africans and from all the talking, he reckoned that there had to be six to eight men at work in the hole.
For three hours, a continuous hammering sound like that of nails being driven into wood, could be heard. Occasionally, he heard the sounds of wood being sawn.
It sounded suspiciously as if they were making a roof for the huge hole. The wood was obviously going to keep the structure up.
Metallic noises similar to that of a metal drum being hit by a baton came from the hole throughout the morning. Eventually, he worked out that in the absence of a ladder, the men were using the drum to get out of the hole and, as they jumped up, they made that tinny noise.
The sun was flashing on some shiny objects under a canopy not 100 metres from Schulie. He suspected they were weapons. but couldn’t risk standing up for a closer examination.
It was becoming more and more apparent that this was no ordinary construction gang going about its business. These were ZIPRA and it suddenly flashed across his mind that had he known they were not civilians, he would have stayed well clear of the area.
But what could they be working on so diligently? Perhaps he had stumbled on to an underground cache in the making ... ?
Then he fell asleep. For it was boring waiting for someone to move in closer to him and he was weary from his previous night’s activities.
The hot September sun beat down on the sleeping soldier.
Suddenly, he forced himself awake.
“No. no ... I mustn’t fall asleep. ‘cos just now I’ll snore and someone will come and investigate,” he silently reminded himself.
At noon, the work party downed tools arid wandered off for lunch.
Schulte’s eyelids began to grow heavy again and he felt himself about to nod off once more. It was definitely time to pull out.
There was plenty of fresh spoor from terrorist boots leading south to the village, which was obviously handy for food and women: and it was clear the ZIPRA men had attended Saturday night’s beer drink.
Back in their little gully, Mick Graham and Bob McKenna sat chatting and wondering what Schallenberg was up to, wondering what they would do if he did not come back. They dined on their high-protein Tarzan Bars, which virtually represented the sum total of their rations that trip.
Eventually, in the late afternoon, Schulie returned to report he had pinpointed the target ... and they all crossed back to Rhodesia.
Schulie had obviously stumbled on a new camp complex still very much in the preparation phase, and it was felt that the hole could only be an underground arms bunker.
When the Brigadier heard the SAS had no immediate plans to mount an attack, he flew down to their base camp on the banks of the Zambezi. For a moment it looked as if commander Garth Barrett was in hot water for pulling his troops out before attacking the camp.
But as Barrett pointed out, the camp was definitely not in a position to be attacked. Were they to hit it too soon, they would achieve virtually nothing.
He got his point across and thereafter the activities at the hole were monitored by aerial reconnaissance. When the photographic interpreters reported that the roof was going on and the hole was probably filled with stores, the SAS decided that the time had come to pounce. It was essential to strike before ZIPRA had the chance of disposing of their arms supply inside Rhodesia.
Some forty-odd SAS troops moved down to the forward tactical headquarters south of the Zambezi, the same one used for the earlier reconnaissances. It was close to Sidinde Island, a District Commissioner’s camp. and used many times by the security forces. A former SAS OC. now with CIO was to be the base commander and the strike force going external would work back to him, keeping him and his stay-behind party in the picture about developments on their operation.
They set up a small communications station .... the radios rested on old batteries ... blankets were spread on the tables in the tents. At night they had the dullest of lights, powered by a car battery. For with Zambia just a couple of metres away and with steep mountains possibly affording terrorists an ideal observation post, they could take no chances.
During the day, the Zodiac boats for the river crossing were hidden under camouflage nets at a small stream running into the Zambezi. At night, the troops rehearsed their beaching drills for the crossing.
Finally the plan was ready and the rehearsals were at an end.
Schulie was to go into the camp to confirm occupation before the main body of men arrived.
He had just come out of hospital after a recurrence of jaundice and was not feeling his fittest. Bob McKenna and Mick Graham, who had been with him on the second reconnaissance, were not available for the mission, and the task of checking the place out, then positioning stop groups, fell to him.
He took in the three stop group commanders and showed them where they would have to attack.
The following night – October 3 – the main group climbed into their boats and shoved off to the northern shores. The engines were muffled, but there was still a bit of noise.
Once across the river they reorganised and with Garth Barrett, the 21C leading, they set off in single file on the long approach, to link up with Schulie who had already plotted the way for them on a time-and-distance basis using compass bearings.
All told, there were 43 SAS chaps, the biggest number of Rhodesian security forces to go external on a single operation into Zambia since the start of the war.
As they got close to the last ridge on their way inland from the Zambezi, Garth Barrett heard movement in front of him. Hewas convinced it was human movement If so, it could mean they had been seen as they crossed the river. He got out his nightsight, but could see no one.
They continued to travel northwards through the night.

Ali Barrett and his forty thieves, as they called themselves later, were quite pleased when they came across a huge bush fire. Now they could have that much-needed smoke without having to worry about terrorists or locals seeing the light from their cigarettes.
Back at the forward base on the other side of the Zambezi, all was still. The full moon shone on the peaceful camp.
It was 02h00. Corporal Phil Cripps had just woken. There was another ten minutes before he went on guard. It was just long enough to snatch another kip. He tried to get back to sleep.
The next he knew, the sound of an AK was ripping through the camp. Phil thought that he was dreaming. Then he heard the attackers changing magazines and realised this was no dream; this was for real.
Two ZIPRA had slipped unseen right up to the camp and emptied their magazines on the eight members of the rear party. Corporal Willie Erasmus sleeping not ten paces from the terrorists was seriously injured. After the first couple of shots he rolled ofThis stretcher and the terrorists continued firing over him.
The SAS could not return fire as it meant shooting over the heads of their own men. Then as quickly as they came, the attackers faded into the night ...
Phil Cripps, who proceeded to have his first smoke for 18 months, had been slightly wounded, as had the former SAS OC.
Perhaps the movement Garth Barrett had seen as they wound their way northwards had come from the attackers watching the main body of men crossing the river? Perhaps the young African boys they had seen herding cattle on the northern banks had told ZIPRA of a security force presence? Maybe it was the usual fishermen who had talked? Subsequent intelligence revealed that the attackers had been en route to the camp the SAS was about to attack, when they decided to take on the sleeping base camp.
In any event, the SAS learnt the hard way that they should never use the same spot time after time for their forward base. Possibly the security forces were complacent in those days thinking that because it was Rhodesia it had to be safe. But as the place was so close to Zambia and as it had been used so many times before, the spot was a natural target for the enemy. .
The base staff decided against telling Garth Barrett of the attack, feeling he might abort the mission and return to his wounded men.
The strike force walked all night and set up their firm base next morning, lying up in the stifling heat of the day.
The mopani trees had no leaves, there was no other natural shade, and they were unable to put any up for fear of being seen. They tried to sleep that day, but it was far too hot, so they were glad to see the sun set, even though it meant they would soon be on the move again.
In the early hours of October 5, they met up with Schulie at the pre-arranged rendezvous point. It had been a hard night’s slog and there were many who thought they would never make it But somehow they managed to make good time.
Schulie led the way to the dispersal point He told the three stop group commanders to select their routes. The two assault teams, one led by Schulie, headed north of the camp.
Garth Barrett had the command stop group on the south-west of the camp and there was a support and other stop groups.
Soon, all the 43 SAS troops were lying low around a still-sleeping camp. Only their eyes moved, but as yet there was nothing to see.
ll was quiet, except for the usual night noises - the birds, the animals, the noise from the nearby stream ... Now all they had to do was to wait for the dawn. They were cold. tired and a little nervous - and it seemed as if the morning would never come.
At last it was just light enough to see.
The assault group positioned themselves in a little gully right on the northern edge of the camp. They could just see a guard moving from one bivvy to another.
![74 - BigBang2](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/74%20-%20bigbang2.png)
As the guard came back, he stopped and looked in their direction. At that, Schulie pulled the first shot, then all hell broke loose.
The sudden roar or automatic fire proceeded to rip the camp apart as the SAS men fired non-stop, their rifles spewing spent cartridges like popcorn machines. They were well organised and were working in pairs, so that when one man stopped to change magazines, his partner took over the firing.
As soon as the attack went in, the SAS saw movement in front of them.
God! The bloody terrs were sleeping in shellscrapes not ten metres from them. They would not have gone that close had they known.
But the terrorists were more intent on getting away than taking on the early-morning callers.
Within five minutes, some 2500 rounds had been directed at the fleeing ZIPRA.
They headed straight for the stop groups positioned around the camp. Some of the enemy had AKs with bayonets fixed on them. One man, shot twice in the chest at point blank range, cartwheeled forward throwing his AK into the air, stopping literally dead two paces in front of his attacker. His bayonet stuck into the ground nearby, with the AK swaying to and fro above it.
“I’m dead, I’m dead,” claimed one injured terrorist hiding in a clump of trees. His prediction was to prove correct
All told, nine ZIPRA, the only ones there that morning, had died in the attack.
But the big prize was still to come. After the camp was cleared, the demolition group quickly moved towards the centre of the camp to inspect the bunker.
A metre of soil and grass hid the entrance from view. Quickly it was removed to reveal a small trap door.
The demolition group lowered themselves through the trap door, dropping on to the drum which Schulie had heard on his reconnaissance. From there they dropped to floor level. They stared in wide-eyed amazement at their incredible find. It was a complete underground reinforced concrete bunker so big an army truck could have quite comfortably turned around in it.
ZIPRA had always hidden their caches underground but spread over a wide area; never on such a grand scale as this.
The cache, which had breathers built into the roof contained a veritable Aladdin’s Cave of arms and ammunition. The Rhodesians had never seen anything like it. It was stacked from top to bottom with hundreds of boxes of ammunition and explosives. There were rifles, rockets, mines, pistols, magazines, holsters, safety fuses and ancillary equipment.
There were boxes and boxes of limpet mines, something the Rhodesians had never seen before. There were even two-metre-long 122 millimetre rockets - they had not seen them before either.
There were millions of rounds, something like 5 000 detonators, Tokarev pistols, 200 Garand rifles from America, never again seen during the war, light machineguns, 12,7 millimetre heavy machineguns, 100 boxes of anti-tank mines, dozens of boxes of anti-personnel mines, AK47s, SKSs, RPG·7 rockets, 75 millimetre recoilless rifles, bayonets. shells ...
Most of the weapons were in specially constructed racks with chains securing them in place. Much of the ammunition was still in its original packing, with weapons still in grease.
Demolitions expert Rob Warraker reckoned there had to be three tons of explosives. There were also large quantities of webbing and clothing.
Just about everyone involved in other tasks around the camp found time to pop their heads into the hole to give the amazing arsenal the once over.
Sergeant Pete Cole, tasked to compile the inventory, did not have the time to check out all the equipment. For the demolitions team, working to a limited time frame, had soon finished laying their charges and wanted him out of the bunker.
Some of the contents - the limpet mines, AKs, bayonets and Tokarevs - were saved their own use and in the hole went a 12,7 millimetre heavy machinegun, a 75 millimetre gun, huge boxes of electric detonators, rolls of detonating cord and safety fuse found above in the camp.
There was enough food in the camp to feed an army. A Rhodesian Army map of Gwelo was found which showed the route ZIPRA planned to take to attack the School of Infantry there.
Landmines were laid on the road, the bodies were searched and documents gathered. Then the majority of the groups began to move out, leaving Rob Warranker to set up the charges and with 2IC Garth Barrett and signaller Dave Cale bringing up the rear.
With an estimated three tons of explosives going up they needed to be at least a kilometre away from the blast.
Rob Warraker caught up with them when they were 500 metres from the cache. They had only gone another fifty metres when the biggest explosion they were ever to experience throughout the long bitter war rumbled across the Zambian country-side.
The shock waves came through the trees like a fierce wind, lifting some men off their feet and throwing them forward.
Ammunition was going off in all directions and enormous chunks of concrete screamed through the air sounding exactly like jet aircraft. For a moment they thought the Zambian Air Force was reacting to their camp attack, and couldn’t quite understand how they had got there so soon.
Then the whistling blocks of concrete obeyed the forces of gravity and hurled groundwards, burying themselves into the shaking soil. It was all rather frightening.
The mushroom cloud from the explosion could be seen ninety kilometres (56 miles) away in Rhodesia.
Back at their base camp over the Zambezi, the ground shook, the water rippled and the leaves fell from the trees. And over the air came signaller Dave Calc’s message in Morse: “Mission successful”.
Then, as the clouds of dust and smoke billowed around the wrecked camp, the SAS began their long hot walk back to the Zambezi, weighed down with captured ammunition, limpet mines, Tokarovs and AK bayonets, stunned by their experience and their ears still ringing from the explosions. But there were big smiles all around.
At a waterfall they stopped to rest Schulie, still recovering from his bout of jaundice, was now feeling very sick.
He was finished; he could not go on, he told the 2IC. Could they not just leave him there to find his own way out, he asked? He certainly knew the damn route by now.
But the boss was against the idea of leaving him on his own. Dave Cale was tasked to cook a meal for him and a portion of rice mixed with mashed pilchards helped perk him up.
As they neared the Zambezi, they radioed base for pick-up and as they crossed over, they learned of the ZIPRA attack on the SAS base camp. The operation - forever nicknamed _Big Bang_ by the SAS - was a major victory for the Rhodesians, a catastrophe for ZIPRA.
The camp - Pondoland East “A” base - had been the central logistical base for the whole of ZIPRA’s operations into Matabeleland.
The cache was being built up to feed the small local caches dug in the Matabcle-land TTLs. The internal network had been smashed: now all the ammunition for the internal caches had been blown to smithereens.
The attack set ZIPRA’s programme back considerably. It took them about six months to resuscitate themselves into a formidable force again.
At that time, _Big Bang_ was the biggest external operation of the war, and Garth Barrett who led the attack was awarded the Order of the Legion of Merit
Schulie, who had carried out the close-in reconnaissance for _Big Bang_ and the previous camp attack on Pondoland “B” base was awarded the Silver Cross of Rhodesia, the country’s second highest gallantry medal for “conspicuous courage and gallantry over and above the call of duty” and undertaking personal reconnaissance of enemy positions with considerable danger and with the risk of discovery”.
He became the first member of the Special Air Service to be awarded the Silver Cross.
His only wish was that Mac Mcintosh, who had been with him on the first reconnaissance, could have shared the award with him, he said in a letter to Mac.
Schulie was to become the first holder of the country’s highest award for gallantry, the Grand Cross of  Valour, equivalent to the Victoria Cross and the American Congressional Medal of Honour. It was awarded while he was serving in the Selous Scouts. Only one other soldier - an SAS officer - was to receive the honour.
Schulie, accepted as the foremost exponent of reconnaissance in the Rhodesian Army, ifnot the world, was described by his SAS colleagues as “a man who emerges only once in a generation”.
His courage, such as displayed on the _Big Bang_ reconnaissances, became legendary in the Rhodesian Anny.
