Since C Squadron’s resurrection in the ‘60s, manpower had always been one of its major problems. First they had to find men, then train them, and this created the unit’s own identity, which differed slightly from the original SAS mould.  
But that identity may have been altered again had the SAS hierarchy got their own way and been permitted to accept non-Europeans into their ranks.  
Until the late ‘60s, the unit was organised, trained and equipped to some extent, along European theatre of war lines.  
And, up to that time, that was adequate, in that the unit functioned satisfactorily, although according to commander Brian Robinson, they should have seen the light much earlier. Only one example is needed to make the point.  
The SAS used to run escape and evasion exercises where the fleeing troops were bound to a _pipeline_. In that broad belt of land they could make contact with various agents or receive help from “safe houses”.  
The exercises were good - but very European.  
For on subsequent operations inside Mozambique, they soon learned there were no safe houses or friendly agents. If a four-man patrol was compromised, that part of Africa became the hunting ground, the entire population became the hunters, and the SAS were open season!  
And the people of their hunting grounds were almost exclusively African and therefore movement through an area, and understanding what was going on in it, was that much easier if the intruder was also an African.  
SAS men may well have dressed up and disguised themselves as Africans wearing _Black-Is-Beautiful_ camouflage cream and may even have disguised their footprints. But in reality, whites cannot pass close examination, as their features are different and to the discerning eye even their spoor is different.  
Then there was the problem of language. Very few SAS soldiers were fluent in Chishonas (prevalent in the north and east of the country) or Sindebele (in the south and west) or both. And it was often very frustrating for a patrol to close brilliantly on a terrorist base camp, listen to the occupants having a serious discussion, but be unable to report back because they did not really understand what was being said.  
The SAS tried private tuition, language laboratories, and had African soldiers teaching them, all of which were fairly successful. But within weeks of developing a talent, it would be gone through lack of conversational practice.
There were more than six million Africans in Rhodesia, so that was hardly a justifiable excuse. Commander Brian Robinson concluded that they were idle and lazy in this respect, but that was the common failing of the white man in most of central and Southern Africa.  
Their next policy in seeking a solution for the inadequacies on operations was to have seconded to the SAS a number of specially selected and experienced African soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Rhodesian African Rifles.  
One African soldier was attached to each four-man patrol and the operational results were greatly improved.  
SAS troops were generally full of praise for the professionalism of these attached African soldiers and what interested Brian was the great mutual affection exhibited between them all when off duty. They all celebrated the coming of 1975 with the roasting of a buffalo they had shot and slightly more than a few beers. Throughout the long celebrations, the Africans remained part of their patrol and did not segregate: and on the other side of the coin, the white members were obviously enjoying their company and were natural with them.  
Perhaps it was because they were with exceptional 1 RAR soldiers and that they were all soldiers together. Either way, it convinced the SAS hierarchy sufficiently to approach the Army Commander, Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, and formally request they be allowed to embody African troops into the unit who had successfully passed the selection course and the parachute and SAS skilled-training courses.  
They were turned down flat.  
They would, they were told, allegedly be duplicating the role of the Selous Scouts, and that was not necessary.  
But it was hardly likely at that time ... the Selous Scouts role was that of tracking down terror gangs _within_ Rhodesia.  
The SAS meanwhile were talking of purely _external_ operations, of close reconnaissance and destruction of camps and communication lines, and perhaps organising counter-groups from the locals within Mozambique - typical SAS work in other words.  
The result in fact was that the Selous Scouts ended up encroaching on the SAS’s role to some extent.  
The Scouts did _not_ have the benefit of any previous experience of “special” operations and the army commander was obliged to give both units specific areas in which they could operate.  
Considering the all-encompassing nature of SAS work in a guerilla war, this was absolutely ludicrous and did little to promote good relations between the two units, Robinson felt.  
At about this time - early 1975 - there were two other incidents that convinced the SAS that official policy on integration in army units was not what it should be.  
The first involved a Lance Corporal Frost, a very light-skinned coloured and a member of a neighbouring army transport company.  
For as long as he could remember, Lance Corporal Frost had admired soldiers. and the SAS, whom he used to watch training near his company, epitomised everything he dreamt of in the military.  
He noticed that the day started early for the SAS training troop with PT and a seven kilometre (four mile) run at 05h45.  
Armed with the knowledge that the SAS was a volunteer unit demanding high standards of physical fitness, he approached the instructors one morning and asked to join the physical training squad.  
“Well, it’s your funeral,” the somewhat nonplussed instructor said, shrugging his shoulders.  
So Frost joined the squad and from that moment didn’t miss a single morning PT session ... in fact, so keen was he that he was very soon a regular member of the afternoon PT class as well.  
Time passed and Frost applied to attend SAS selection and this was granted as a matter of course.  
The only problem was that the SAS did not know he was a coloured as the transport company also had white NCOs.  
Having eventually mustered all candidates for the selection course, the training troop departed for the rigours of the Eastern Highlands.  
Lance Corporal Frost had successfully completed one leg of the course when the SAS received the news from Army HQ - who had been told the names of the SAS volunteers on selection - that Frost was a coloured.  
He was ordered to rejoin his unit.  
It is easy to imagine the tremendous disappointment experienced by Frost, who without doubt would have passed the course through sheer determination to realise his dreams and elevate himself from a rather second-grade citizen to a prestigious SAS soldier.  
It was not easy telling Frost either, he was well liked by the training troop.  
To his credit he held no umbrage against the SAS ... and such was his determination that he tried to join the “Supers” for a second time about a year later.  
Although his application was submitted, it was refused again - and there ends the tale. Perhaps it was being sentimental but Brian Robinson felt Frost deserved better than that.  
At the same time, the SAS also had in its ranks a Lieutenant Martin Knight-Willis. a well-decorated soldier who had come from the New Zealand SAS.  
Through correspondence and visits home on leave, he obviously described the conditions and experiences to be enjoyed in Rhodesia ... and this resulted in queries from New Zealanders who were interested in joining the Rhodesian unit.  
Among them was a sergeant, well known to Martin, who spoke very highly of the applicant. The sergeant was a Maori.  
The SAS made enquiries to Army Headquarters and the reaction in a nutshell was “Bloody good those Maoris - but what about his family? Would they fit in socially?”  
Brian Robinson was livid.  
His whole point was that the unit was always short of manpower. The SAS was a volunteer unit with very stringent selection. If there was any doubt surrounding an individual, the SAS got the benefit and on his way he went.  
Standards started high and if anything had got higher over the years, so to have mixed races in the unit would not be allowed to affect their proficiency, he felt.  
The consensus at the time was wholeheartedly behind the OC, although there were some who believed otherwise ... that the unit’s professionalism would have dropped had other races been accepted into their ranks.  
The SAS commander, however, was a fierce taskmaster as men who did not fit their commander’s high standards found to their cost. The unit, _not_ the personality, came first in Brian’s book and he stood no nonsense from anyone, be he black, white or coloured; trooper or officer.  
But it was not to be ... and the SAS remained exclusively white.
