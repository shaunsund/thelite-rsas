Marymount Mission - where the unit was based - was administered by a German missionary… and at this time of the war, missionaries and the soldiers were not always on the same side.  
Missionaries tended to hold anti-Government, pro-nationalist views, and the German missionary, who was suspected of actively assisting the enemy, was certainly not keen to have the SAS based at the end of his airstrip.  
But, as he pointed out to Lieutenant Bob McKenna. he really didn’t have any say in the matter - they had the guns and he didn’t.  
Nevertheless, the two men established a workable relationship and the missionary finally offered the soldiers the use of his swimming pool and showers. Bob negotiated the timings for his men to use the pool as they had to fit in with the missionaries timetable and that of his black staff.  
Unbeknown to the missionaries. the flamboyant Minister of Defence P. K. van der Byl had arrived for a visit to his troops in the bush.  
“PK” as he was affectionately known to Rhodesians, was frightfully British and old school tie. He was a master of the Churchillian phrase and generally considered eccentric. The troops thought he was magnificient.  
There was no one quite like PK in their eyes; and indeed no other Defence Minister had such a rapport with the troopies.  
“Good bugger, old PK,” remarked one SAS soldier after the minister had arrived.“And more to the point, he’s brought a bottle of whisky with him. Imported of course.” PK arrived at Marymount wearing khaki shorts and displaying a large expanse of pale spindly legs. He was wearing a British stable belt and had a captured AK over his shoulder.  
He told Brian Robinson that he couldn’t make up his mind what uniform he was going to wear. Perhaps, just to keep everyone happy, he said, he would wear an RLI stable belt and SAS wings.  
“Well, I don’t know about the stable belt. Minister,” replied Brian Robinson witheringly. “But you certainly won’t be wearing SAS wings!”  
During his stay at Marymount, some of the SAS troops returned from the bush and went for a shower out of the prescribed times ... and the German missionary was most unimpressed with them.  
At 10h00, still dressed in his baggy pyjamas, he stormed down to the SAS camp in a highly agitated state to demand an interview with the military.  
Bob McKenna tried to be as diplomatic as he could but the conversation was beginning to get slightly heated.  
“What can I do?” the missionary wailed yet again. “You’ve got all the guns.” “Yes,” the SAS officer agreed, “_we’ve_ got all the guns.”  
Listening to the unholy row from the inside of his tent was the Minister of Defence. Suddenly, the lanky figure of PK emerged from behind the flaps of his tent. Introducing himself as the Minister of Defence, he drew himself up and continued:  
“Listen, my dear fellow,” he pointed out, “if you don’t like these chaps using your swimming pool I will take away your swimming pool. And if you don’t like that, I will take your whole mission - all the buildings, all the tractors and everything in it - and close it down.  
“And not only will I take away your swimming pool and close down the mission, but I will also deport you ... and you’ll never see this place again.  
“Now - what have you got to say to that?”  
Needless to say, there wasn’t much the poor trembling missionary could say. He turned tail and, with his pyjamas flapping around him, stormed off mumbling to himself in German. The timetable was thrown away and the troops were showering and swimming in the pool that afternoon.
