By April, 1974, there had been many changes in the unit, and according to notes written at the time by one officer. Lieutenant Chris Schollenberg: “In little over a year, Brian Robinson had done much to make the unit one of the best of the Rhodesian scene. From a peacetime army, the SAS became one of the most professional units in Southern Africa, if not the world.”  
But now Brian Robinson was out of action with hepatitis and Captain Garth Barrett, the 2IC, was acting OC.  
Since the start of Operation _Hurricane_, the SAS had been involved in operations against terrorist and logistics bases in Mozambique. However, fresh intelligence coming in was about to bring a change of scenery.  
When the existence of three Zambian-based ZIPRA camps became known to the intelligence agencies, it was decided to send in an SAS reconnaissance team to pin-point one of them known as Pondoland East “B” and believed to accommodate some fifty ZIPRA.  
On the evening of April 9, 26 members of the SAS arrived at the district commissioner’s camp at Sibankwazi police station on the Rhodesian bank of the Zambezi River, with CIO officer _Sneaky Jack_, two SB representatives, a former SAS adjutant Ken Phillips, now the 1 Brigade intelligence officer, boosting their numbers.  
As usual with cross-border missions, the operation was shrouded in secrecy and most activity took place at night, so as not to arouse undue suspicion from the northern bank.  
The command group and the reconnaissance team moved into their allotted houses by the river. The windows were covered with blankets and movement was restricted to the rear, well away from the prying eyes of the Zambian fishermen, who wisely hedged their bets and fed the Zambian-based insurgents and the Rhodesians alike with intelligence.  
The main body of men, meanwhile, set up their camp in a gully near the river.  
Then, while the officers and some of the men threw themselves into the preparation phase, others got on with the more devious business of reconnaissance.  
In the early days of the war, it was not unusual for white fishermen to be seen at the DC’s camp ... and Ken Phillips, the SB representatives and CIO man Sneaky Jack turned this to their advantage.  
Dressed in suitable clothing, they boarded a boat and under the guise of being fishermen, silently reccied the river banks for suitable crossing points and logged the whereabouts of the ever-changing positions of the black fishermen on the northern banks.  
To any interested onlooker on the Zambian bank they would have passed for the real thing. And, as a bonus, the fish they caught made a welcome change to their normal army _ratpacks_.  
They were hopeful too that their little trips would ultimately lead to the netting of much bigger fish ...  
Other SAS troops took up observation points on the rugged terrain through which the Zambezi wound its way, where, from their high positions, they silently watched the Zambian banks for any signs of enemy activity.  
During the day, the pseudo fishermen withdrew so as to leave the peaceful atmosphere undisturbed and the real fishermen and the enemy unsuspecting.  
The reconnaissance team meanwhile studied their maps and aerial photographs and worked out how they could find ZIPRA’s Pondoland East “B” base.  
Chris Schallenberg was to command the reconnaissance team and Schulie had chosen Bob McKenna, Brian Jackson and Jop Oosthuizen to go along with him. The estimate of fifty terrorists said to be in the camp did nothing to soothe their nerves.  
They knew that the area under investigation was about 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the Zambezi was sparsely populated and generally only used by fishermen traveling from the interior down to the Zambezi.  
Occasionally, fishermen traveling on the only old track down to the river were stopped by ZIPRA and quizzed about security forces activity on the southern shore. Often, the fishermen saw two and three-man ZIPRA hunting parties searching for game.  
In view of the vast numbers of game trails criss-crossing the countryside, the Rhodesians had been unable to pick up the exact location of the ZIPRA camp. From the air it was impossible to differentiate between the track patterns of small and hidden bases and that of game trails near a water-hole, vital for both game and guerillas.  
Pinpointing the enemy came down to a simple process of deduction and elimination. They had to be somewhere close to the old track which snaked on its way down to the river; they had to be near water - and there were not many rivers carrying water at that time of the year.  
It was impossible for fifty men to hide for long in an uninhabited area with sparse vegetation. There were only few dense patches of trees too where the enemy could be hiding.  
The ZIPRA men had to hunt to replenish their rations and enemy shots could be heard over long distances.  
The SAS knew that if there were ZIPRA troops in the area, they would have no difficulty finding them ... and by studying the maps and the aerial photographs, two areas were selected as likely hiding places that needed investigation.  
On secret cross-border operations such as these, it was crucial that every contingency be catered for ... from what to do if there was a contact ... what action they had to follow on an ambush ... what to do if they got separated and lost ... Even on the most mundane missions, nothing could be left to chance.  
They would wear _Black is Beautiful_ camouflage cream to give them the edge ... and to add to the deception. they would use bare feet on paths just as the local civilians did.  
Small binoculars and nightsights would prove vitally important items. A more mundane but essential item, was the torch each operator would carry to aid his pick-up from the river bank. And, as a last-resort measure, they would carry cyanide phials.  
Timings for the operation were going to be crucial. For the mission to succeed, they had to cross the Zambezi unseen and unheard. Too much light, and they would be seen; too little, and they would be unable to find the terror base.  
It was felt that the most suitable time for the river crossing was a day or two after the full moon. Between dusk and the rising of the moon, there would be a state of total darkness over the Zambezi ... while the moonlight afterwards would serve to speed the recce patrol along once inside enemy territory.  
For several days there was much frenzied activity as preparations neared completion. Launching. positions were found and a route was chosen on which to man-handle the equipment needed for the river crossing.  
A Zodiac was to be used as a rescue craft in case the recce party got into difficulties. The inside of the engine cowlings were lined with polystyrene and the whole engine was covered by a blanket to muffle the sounds.  
The night of the full moon came and went Finally on April 15, it was time to go.  
The four-man reconnaissance team was to be taken across into Zambia by the ferry party which would return later for the pick-up ... while a mortar team was to remain south of the river to provide protection if need be.  
The timings turned out to be perfect. Undercover of that pitch black night, their kit was transferred to the water’s edge and the canoes were assembled and placed in the river.  
The reconnaissance group and the ferry party climbed into the canoes, which were designed to take two men. but it was a tight squeeze that night - there were two operators. a ferryman and a mountain of equipment to each canoe.  
Commander Garth Barrett wished them a good trip und they silently set sail for terrorist country.  
But then, within twenty metres, came a problem.  
A fast-moving whirlpool suddenly sucked the front canoe into the murky, swirling waters of the Zambezi, tossing Brian Jackson and ferryman Ben Botha into the river ... and sending all the untied equipment to the bottom of the river.  
Brian Jackson and Ben Botha remained on the surface. then began to Iloat downstream on the current - leaving Bob Mckenna. the third passenger, hanging upside down in the overturned canoe. trapped by his webbing which had caught on the struts and hooks.  
With almost superhuman strength, Bob McKenna managed to twist himself up into a contortionist’s position, then he began trying to free himself with one hand and grip on to the boat with the other. But no amount of struggling was helping to set him free.  
He had a mere five centimetres of air trapped in the canoe and as he drifted downstream in the swiftly-moving current, all he could think about was what little air he did have, would eventually disappear altogether - and that the canoe would sink with him still trapped in it.  
Brian Jackson, by now striking out for the shore, suddenly realised that Bob McKenna was missing and turned back to rescue his friend.  
When he caught up with the canoe, he half climbed on to it ... and Bob’s precious few centimetres of air suddenly began to diminish.  
Bob gurgled a “Get off” and Brian Jackson obliged.  
Then a much-relieved Bob squeezed his rescuer’s leg to indicate he was all right. The two men whispered to each other through the skin of the canoe as they continued to be washed downstream, ever-conscious that a raised voice could alert anyone watching or listening on the Zambian bank.  
Brian eventually set Bob free at about the same time the rescue boat started up its engines and began purring softly towards the drenched. drifting men.  
Then to round the whole thing off the steering mechanism on the second canoe came undone, allowing only port steer. But with a bit of luck, and skillful paddling, the canoeists managed to return to the launching spot after a huge circle battling the fierce current.  
The crossing had been a catastrophe. Equipment needed for the mission was missing and although their rifles had been tied to the boat, they were drenched. Two members of the reconnaissance party were soaked to the skin and one had barely escaped with his life.  
The recce commander asked for a postponement to get a re-issue of equipment, but the 2IC Garth Barrett said they had to continue. They could not delay any longer, for the chance of compromise could only increase as time progressed.  
In the east, a glow appeared in the dark sky which preceded the rising moon.  
If they were to cross unseen that night, they would have to get going.  
With Bob McKenna and Brian Jackson now out of the operation. volunteers were quickly called for from the main reserve. Tim Hallow and Willie Mac Mcintosh volunteered to go along.  
Mac was just a young soldier but he had become an old hand at volunteering. Whenever Schulie asked for volunteers, Mac was always the first to join him, and it was to become the accepted thing for him to go along with Schulie. Mac could not have asked for a better tutor. He learnt his lessons well and close-in reconnaissance was to become his own particular speciality.  
Schulie had only 15 minutes to put them in the picture about the task ahead, and while they shoved borrowed rations and maps into make-do packs, he quickly ran through the situation from his brief notes. Once the new boys were satisfied with the plan, the team once again shoved off for Zambia.  
This time there were no mishaps and the canoes beached successfully on the northern bank The moon started to rise with only minutes to spare.  
Hopefully, the fisherman next to his fire a few hundred metres downstream was unaware of the crossing. Crossings normally took place near rapids where any sounds made by the infiltrators were smothered by the rushing waters: but that had been impossible this time. The actual beach was rocky so there would be no give-away footprints to tell the tale next day.  
They slung their packs down at the first high ground they reached, and hastily rearranged their kit.  
The initial panic was over. Schulie was always relieved to reach the stage where everyone else was off their backs and the pressure ofT.From now onwards the team alone dictated the conduct of the operation with only minimum interference from control at the other end of the TR-48 radio, the _Big Means_.  
By midnight, they had reached the first area under suspicion. But there were no signs of the enemy and no spoor from terrorist boots on the dry, sandy road.  
Suddenly, using their nightsight, they picked up the soft glow of the dying embers of a fire.  
Carefully, they approached the centre of the dark vegetation stopping many times to listen for breathing ... snoring ... talking ... ever-alert to the possibility of stumbling into unseen enemy or their bushy hideout.  
As soon as darkness came down, they checked a gully using the shaded light of their torches and found a man-made footpath crossing over it. Now they were on to something.  
Quickly, Schulie and Jop Oosthuizen left their packs with Mac McIntosh and Tim Hallow just off the newly discovered footpath and quietly discussed rendezvous procedures. Then Schulie and Jop moved towards the denser area near the river which had all the makings of an ideal enemy hide-up position.  
Schulie briefed his companion to wait off the path to warn of anyone coming from the rear. Then he slowly moved in to carry out a one-man close-in reconnaissance.  
He lay low in the darkness and waited.  
From behind the thicket to the right of the path came the sound of a tin being banged against another metal object It was the first indication of an enemy presence.  
Then, he heard the sound of a radio with the volume turned low; then the low voices of three men talking.  
Schulie moved around the camp to establish its size. It was a time-consuming but productive exercise, revealing two occupied positions.  
He heard snoring coming from at least five terrorists; but in view of the size of the camp, he felt it could well be occupied by dozens of enemy.  
He rejoined the others, and they agreed they had pinpointed the enemy camp and could definitely pick it up on aerial photography the next day.  
Their mission over, they melted back into the night and headed south. Back at the river’s edge, the pin-prick glow from their shielded torches told the boat party waiting on the southern shores that they were ready to return … and they were soon on their way home.  
As anticipated. they were able to locate the terror base from the aerial photographs and a track showing a vehicle turnaround point was clearly visible on the pictures.  
Within a few weeks, a much larger group of blackened-up SAS men tramped through the night arriving on the outskirts of the ZIPRA camp several hours before their planned first-light attack.  
They were hot and sweaty from their long walk, but it was a bitterly cold winter’s night and their perspiration seemed to turn to ice. Most had not expected to arrive so soon and were totally unprepared for what seemed to the Rhodesians to be Arctic conditions. Even the chaps from Britain, traditionally made of sterner stuff when it came to wintry weather, were feeling the cold.  
Many tried to snuggle into the ground to get warm and some climbed into the bags in which they had carried their RPG·7 rockets.  
Eventually, dawn broke over the sleeping camp and the SAS silently got into an assault formation and eased forward eager to get going at last.  
They got so close to the motley collection of grubby white and green tents that they expected to be seen any second by the sentries. But there was no reaction; no movement. All was silent.  
Then they let rip, firing low into the tents. hoping to catch the enemy as they lay asleep in their beds. Again there was no reaction from the fifty or so enemy they hoped to catch inside. They slashed an entry through the sides of the tents and discovered the reason - ZIPRA had vacated the camp.  
The attackers did, however, manage to account for the camp logistics officer. But missed another man, who with impeccable timing had slipped out of his tent to answer the call of nature.  
The early-morning visitors salvaged many weapons, including brand new RPG-7 rockets which would go to augmenting their own meagre supplies, then blew up what was left.  
A couple of land mines were laid in the access road, then, confident no one would see them, the SAS returned home.  
Next day, an aerial reconnaissance was carried out and a gaping hole found where once the landmines had been - as well as an upturned Land-Rover straddled across the treetops. A few more ZIPRA had died.  
The SAS continued to plant mines on all access roads to all camps they attacked throughout the war ... and almost invariably the enemy continued to hit them.  
The kills, captured arms and a few valuable documents which were 10 lead to even bigger stuff had made the mission worthwhile.
