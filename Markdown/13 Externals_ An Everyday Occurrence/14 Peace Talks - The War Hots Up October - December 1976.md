On the political front the bitter war of words had begun again.
At a summit meeting in Pretoria, the American Secretary of State, Dr Henry Kissinger, made it abundantly clear to Ian Smith that he was in a no-win war, that Russia would increase its commitment to Smith’s enemies and that the pressures on Rhodesia from the free world would continue to mount. And America would simply write off Rhodesia.
But there was, it seemed, a way out. Kissinger handed Smith a piece of paper which set out a five-point package deal suggesting Rhodesia agree to majority rule within two years … agree to meet the black nationalists … and that an interim government should consist of the Council of State, half black, half white, with the job of drawing up a majority rule constitution.
The Rhodesian premier, who had vowed there would be no majority rule in a thousand years, was unimpressed. They wanted him to sign his own suicide note, he commented flatly.
The heat of international pressure was on and the Rhodesian Cabinet had no option but to go along with the Kissinger proposals. South Africa would make sure the Rhodesians signed.
Kissinger, who hoped to pull off a settlement just before the American presidential election in November, realised that the key to breaking Ian Smith was South African premier John Vorster.
As far as Pretoria was concerned, the Smith regime, recognised by not a single country in the world and the cause of raised tensions in the region, had outlived its usefulness. Rhodesia had become an embarrassment to Pretoria’s “outward policy” and an obstacle in the way of better relations with Black Africa and the West.
South Africa wanted a gradual peaceful transition to a moderate pro-Western black ruled country north of the Limpopo. Kissinger’s plan was that America would help Vorster set up a Kenyan-style government in an independent Rhodesia/ Zimbabwe.
That South Africa - under seige herself and with an uprising in the black township of Soweto - was in turn under pressure from the international community, was obvious.
South Africa paid half of Rhodesia’s defence budget, and to get the point across, the money, weapons and ammunition had suddenly dried up. The Rhodesiaus had been waiting months to hear if South Africa would support them for another year.
Rhodesians were brave, but even they couldn’t fight without ammunition.
Then South Africa turned her attention towards Rhodesia’s main export and import artery which ran through South Africa. Soon, some Rh$125m (R72m, US$82m, £50m) worth of Rhodesian goods had piled up in South Africa. The border was closed during the Kissinger Summit and Rhodesia’s precious oil supplies were down to an all-time low of 19,6 days. The situation was critical and leaders of business and industry urged Smith to act rapidly.
But Big Brother “down south” was going for the jugular and there were no options left.
Kissinger told Smith that the proposals were essentially British ones, with American backing (The British, however, felt a settlement was impossible as long as Smith remained in office.) Kissinger would support the proposals as long as he (Kissinger) remained in power, but that if Jimmy Carter won the elections, there would be no settlement anyway.
In return for accepting the proposals, the British and American Governments assured Smith there would be an end to terrorism, lifting of sanctions and an injection of development capital The Rhodesian premier had grave reservations that the enemy would oblige and end the war, and correctly predicted an increase in terrorist activity.
He insisted that the head of the Council of State and the Ministers of Defence and Law and Order be whites and Kissinger agreed to consult the front-line presidents on such points of detail.
The nationalists didn’t like the Kissinger package either, but they too, under pressure from the frontline states, would go to the summit to be held in Geneva. They even formed an “alliance” called the Patriotic Front, but it was no more than a fragile coalition. It did, however, bring them together as a joint negotiating team, reducing the possibility of Smith, the British and Americans playing on divisions.
Whatever the outcome of the conference, the Kissinger shuttle had forced white Rhodesia to change course. The suicide note had marked the death knell of white-ruled Rhodesia, setting in motion a chain of events that would end almost 1 000 days later with the first one-man-one-vote elections.
The war, meanwhile, continued unabated ...

SAS Second-In-Command Mick Graham declared in the squadron diary that no one in the unit got over-excited about the Kissinger proposals, firstly because they were too busy; secondly because people changed their minds too often, and for most people, it was too mind-boggling anyway!
The white politicians and the black nationalists were to meet in Geneva and the Geneva Conference era marked an intensive phase for both security forces and enemy.
An unprecedented number of insurgents poured across the border during the last three months of the year … and for their part, the security forces struck at external bases, disrupted infiltration routes and destroyed and captured tonnes of arms and ammunition.
Operation _Mardon_ was the first major external during that phase and was planned to counter an imminent ZANLA infiltration threat in the north and eastern areas, it constituted a 72-hour pincer air-ground thrust, one from _Hurricane_ in the Tete Province, the other from _Repulse_ into Gaza, covering in all a 241 kilometre ( 1.50 mile) arc.
In Tele, the engineers cut the _cordon sanitaire_ (landmine) fence and cleared a path into the province, and the SAS and RLI marched on to their first targets. Then some 83 vehicles crossed the border to carry troops to their next targets.
Horses belonging to the Grey Scouts carried the heavy 81 millimetre mortars across a river and through the breach, and it was only through the determination and skill of an SAS sergeant who swam across the river with the horses, and made them leap off huge rocks into the swirling waters below, then guided them through the very small breach, that the animals made it at all.
Several camps were attacked, many enemy killed and the troops discovered so many arms caches thai by the end of the first day, it had lost its novelty. Much of the weaponry was recovered and the remainder destroyed. The Rhodesians also captured FRELIMO’s Portuguese paymaster and his one million escudoes, and “liberated” a precious tractor. Two Rhodesians - SAS Trooper Ed Lotringer and RLI Trooper Grahame Fanner - were fatally wounded and a Grey Scout lost a leg when he walked on an anti-personnel mine washed out of the mine cordon.
As the column pushed deeper into Tete Province, it became apparent that ZANLA had fled to Tete town, and the column commanders eventually decided to call it a day.
“The other point is, that having by now travelled nearly 100 kilometres (62 miles) inside Mozambique, the ‘hot pursuit’ ruse was starting to wear a little thin.” commented the SAS Second-In-Command.

Within days, the SAS and RLI were back inside Mozambique attacking the Mavue terror base and killing 31 enemy. From now until the end of the year the security forces continued to hit ZANLA with good results … and in December a combined 5AS/RLI force attacked a camp at Rambanayi a few kilometres from the Rhodesian border which housed a platoon of Tanzanians, the first the Rhodesians had encountered.
The Tanzanians were holed up in a complex of underground bunkers, and while most of the twenty-strong platoon fled for their lives, the others chose to fight it out.
Winkling them out proved a time-consuming business. There were many sharp comers which were difficult to reach and many bunkers were covered by large logs and earth. Various methods were tried which were all unsuccessful and the attackers finally solved the problem by using the Viet Nam trick of pouring petrol through the weapon slits, then throwing in a match.
Ultimately, as a result of the lessons learned at Rambananyi, the army, with much SAS assistance, developed a bunker bomb which was designed to lift the lids straight off trenches.
By the end of the day, many Tanzanians, FRELIMO and ZANLA were killed and the Rhodesians lost RLI Corporal Butch Alexander in the attack. SAS Lieutenant Bruce Burrell and Trooper Enslin Van Staden were killed when they detonated a landmine on the walk out. The operation had been a success and the SAS had acquitted themselves well but as two trooper Steve Seymour and Boet Nel had been killed a few days earlier, the unit was somewhat stunned at losing four good men in such a short space of time.
By December, the Honde Valley on the eastern border had become a very hot area. There were continual infiltrations and ZANLA had carried out large-scale attacks against Ruda police station. Then just before Christmas, 27 African tea estate workers were rounded up, forced to lie on the ground and massacred in one of the bloodiest single incidents of the war.
Captured ZANLA revealed that insurgents were staging from Mavonde, a small base just ten kilometres (six miles) from Abervoyle Tea Estates. The operation that was mounted marked the beginning of the SAS’s interest in house-fighting and was excellent training for the major operations that were to follow.
The buildings in Mavonde were in three rows and the assault team split into groups and moved into town, firing their RPG-7s, scuttling in through doors and windows.
advancing efficiently and systematically from building to building, keeping pace with each other, and only advancing on a new target when the other teams were abreast of them.
lain Bowen successfully blew up the nearby bridge and the various booby traps he left behind later scored hits, bringing the total of enemy killed on the mission to 44.

By now it was obvious that a negotiated settlement was as elusive as ever. The seven-week Geneva Conference, doomed even before it had begun, had ended inconclusively, never to be resumed.
Kissinger had conceded details to Smith, which according to the Frontline Presidents, who had the job of bringing the nationalists to heel should have been points for negotiation. In any event, the nationalists - who would never lay down their arms while the whites were still in control of the security forces - hadn’t even been consulted, and Kissinger had met only Joshua Nkomo.
The American had spent some seven minutes with Nkomo and he “spoke in short sentences in a dull, flat voice, like a businessman doing a quick deal” said Nkomo in his autobiography. “His ideas were of no interest to us.”
Smith stuck to Kissinger’s five points, arguing they were not negotiable.., while the black nationalists considered them irrelevant. One described the conference as “a load of crap”, and there were many in the opposition camp who would not have argued.
In a letter to _The Rhodesia Herald_ a reader suggested that as the enemy had sent a delegation to Geneva and as the conference had already passed the point of the ridiculous, it would surely not be remiss of the army to send a delegation from the SAS in hot pursuit.
SAS scribe Major Mick Graham commented that the unit would have loved to oblige: but it was a shame that nobody had come forward to sponsor such an operation.

By now, South Africa had taken the heat off and promised more guns and oil.
Kissinger had lost his job after the American elections brought Jimmy Carter to power. Mugabe and Nkomo had gone their separate ways - and the war continued much as everyone back in Rhodesia suspected it would anyway ...
