Shortly before Rhodesia staged her rebellion and declared UDI. Brian Robinson, one of the unit’s new young lieutenants, went to Britain on attachment to 22 SAS, absorbing all he could about the role of the SAS and soaking up atmosphere from the masters.
He was only the second Rhodesian SAS officer to have been attached to 22 and It was an invaluable experience; one which was ultimately to have a direct effect on the way the Rhodesian Special Air Service was to develop.
For all Brian’s initial ideas were based on what 22 were doing on their operations behind enemy lines. By living with them. talking to them. thinking SAS 24 hours a day, the young Rhodesian gained a unique insight into what the SAS was all about what they should do, and perhaps just as importantly, what they should not do.
It was 1965 and 22 SAS were working right into Borneo, and the closer Brian Robinson got to know the operators, the more he heard about the sort of operations they were doing there ... seeking out enemy camps, leading in the infantry to attack them, melting into the night and going on to their next task. It was the typical everyday work, the deep penetration behind the-scenes clandestine work that made the SAS what it was.
Suddenly, all the SAS’s well-known clichés - _long range deep penetration, seek and destroy, shoot-’n’-scoot_ - became part of Brian’s life.
Then, having got himself on the night manifest to go to Borneo with 22 SAS, UDI happened, and the adjutant called Brian in to spell out exactly what it meant to the Rhodesian soldier.
“Look. I’m awfully sorry about this,” he told Brian “but you are no longer welcome here.”
And that was that. Brian Robinson was on the next plane to Rhodesia.
It was a big blow and Brian was bitterly disappointed. He knew he could have gamed a wealth of experience in Borneo that could have been used back home in Rhodesia.
Now that it was 1973 and the Rhodesian SAS was working externally in Mozambique, he saw it as an ideal opportunity to employ his men in their proper role, Just as 22 SAS had done in Borneo.
The squadron could act as the eyes and ears of the Rhodesian Army. providing the infantry with information for their attacks On terrorist bases and routes. The SAS’s role was not necessarily to do the killing, as most people in Rhodesia thought Since the desert days, the SAS’s role was not to engage the enemy, but to outwit them.
But getting that message across was not such a straight-forward task.
For the first few months after the Frank Wilmot incident, the SAS were working south of the Zambezi River, watching and monitoring ZANLA and FRELlMO movements.
It became very apparent that the so-called Ho Chi Minh trail was far more than one simple route, which would have been easy to ambush. It was a whole series of routes running through villages and kraals, in a vast area that was something like seventy kilometres (45 miles) wide.
But sitting and watching paths, and acting as the eyes and ears, took time, and the average soldier sometimes could not understand why the SAS were doing it.
Rhodesian SAS soldiers were young, magnificent - and like all soldiers. they wanted action. And they could not help feeling that by making them sit and watch paths for weeks on end, their commander was messing them around.
Nothing could have been further from the truth. Brian Robinson realized that it took time, often months. to build up a picture, to establish where the many infiltration routes were, which could ultimately lead to big ambushes being mounted and to large-scale camp attacks.
Yet while the SAS continued to follow their traditional role and act as eyes and ears for the infantry, the plan was not followed to its logical conclusion because - according to Brian Robinson - the SAS did not have the benefit of adequate support troops.
All SAS information was passed back to Two Brigade ops room where the staff spent their time putting lines and stickers all over the maps where they intended positioning cut-off troops. It all looked extremely impressive on the maps. On the ground however, it was not so good
It became extremely frustrating for the SAS, having risked their lives and located groups of 150 or so ZANLA moving southwards each day, to call in a group of infantry which was unable to react effectively and eliminate the insurgents ... thereby leaving ZANLA to continue on their way unopposed and infiltrate into Rhodesia.
Ideally, what was needed, Brian felt, was a superior infantry unit like the British Parachute Brigade. But that was just not available in Rhodesia and Brian eventually conceded that if their information was not followed-up effectively, the SAS were just wasting their time.
Having at long last managed to convince everyone that the SAS’s role was not to kill the enemy but to act as eyes and ears. Brian then began to fight for the right to do the infantry’s job for them - to kill the enemy!
He was basically fighting against himself, but he had no choice. If the enemy were to be stopped, the SAS would just have to do the job themselves ... and what started as reconnaissance turned into a hit-and-run hunter-killer role, which was acceptable to Brian Robinson as it was the _shoot-’n’-scoot_ of the Borneo days - a volley, inflicting casualties then disappearing into the night as soon as possible.
The SAS troops themselves certainly welcomed the opportunity to be unleashed and do something positive to put a stop to the enemy.
As they were working so far from Salisbury, a tactical headquarters was established at an old mission station at Musengezi in Rhodesia from where the helicopters and aircraft were on standby to speed across the border for casevacs, airstrikes, resupply, trooping and extraction.
It didn’t take too long for the Rhodesians to realize that if they were to turn the terrorist tide effectively, they needed to get right to the source - and that meant operating _north_ of the Zambezi, taking the war right to the Zambian border where, ZANLA were crossing over in their journey down Mozambique and into Rhodesia.
It meant doing deep-penetration operations; it also meant they needed a permanent forward base _inside_ Mozambique ... and in September, 1973, the SAS established a permanent tactical headquarters at Macombe, a Portuguese aldeamento (a strategic protected village) with an all-important airstrip on the south bank of the Zambezi.
Aircraft remained on standby at Macombe forward tactical headquarters during the day and were pulled back to Musengezi rear admin base at night. for they would have been sitting ducks to any enemy hidden in the thick surrounding bush and armed with mortars or rocket launchers.
Macombe aldeamento - housing civilians to protect them from the rampages of FRELIMO - was at one end of the grass and dirt airstrip and the SAS tactical headquarters was in a tented camp part way down the runway. The troops based up bivvies under the trees around the camp.
A number of armed black militia guarded Macombe and although they came under the control of the Portuguese Army in Tete, they had been left very much to their own devices.
There were few roads and these were so heavily mined the militia ventured out from the safety of the aldeamento only every few months to make the long and hazardous trek to their nearest control station at Zumbo, sixty kilometres (37 miles) away, to collect their pay.
The arrival of the SAS at Macombe was one of the most classically successful counter-insurgence operations of the entire war. The RAR were to join them later and they kept the area south of the river clear of enemy while the SAS worked north.
Although their boundaries were set to some extent by the Portuguese. the SAS s area of operation became more and more flexible and the greater successes they had the more terrorist camps they destroyed. the more they forced the enemy northwards and away from the Rhodesian border.
The SAS began at the Zambezi and just kept walking towards Zambia, dominating the area and keeping the enemy on the run.
So successful were the SAS’s hunter-killer tactics, and so deep inside Mozambique were they, that for a while, the enemy were taken totally by surprise and didn’t know where they had come from.
When ZANLA and FRELIMO finally worked out that the SAS were in the area they actively went in search or them, increasing their groups from twenty to sixty to give them more confidence. They even brought in dogs to hunt down the SAS men.
The SAS would parachute into a single DZ previously selected and received by a freefall pathfinder group, and cache their parachutes in plastic bags. They would then spilt up into their various patrols and ran out towards their prescribed areas to carry out their tasks of ambushing, patrolling, observing and locating camps and the main infiltration routes into Rhodesia.
Unless there was a need for them to regroup for a camp attack, the patrols would not meet up again until the end or their six-week stint.
If they were not pulled back to Macombe forward tactical headquarters … a parachute resupply would be dropped in to them every 14 days with food, radio batteries, medical supplies and ammunition.
This period became known as the _Macombe_ Days - and it served to sort the men from the boys.
Many soldiers fell by the wayside when Brian Robinson began insisting that every SAS man hiding away in a little corner of SAS HQ, who was lit and able and drawing para-pay had to go on ops into Mozambique. Those who did not were posted to other units.
The length of the operations took their toll on some of the married men too. The normal operation was six weeks in the bush and ten days back in Salisbury, which in those early days of the war was unheard of.
The Macombe saga lasted more than a year, but long before it came to an end, many married men, placed under a lot of marital pressure, had moved on to join units which were not so demanding.
Waging war north of the Zambezi was tough and those SAS men who managed to overcome the rigors of the _Macombe Days_, went on to become the mainstay of the SAS in later years.
The Macombe Days era was an entirely new ball game. They were a very long way from home and left very much to their own devices.
It was new even to the most experienced combat soldiers who had seen service in Viet Nam or Aden. In those particular theatres there was always air support somewhere near at hand, and no matter how deep into the interior they were, they could be confident that within a matter of minutes of calling for support, the planes would be overhead dropping ofT their deadly payloads.
That was not the case in the _Macombe Days_. Generally, an ageing Provost plane had to struggle up from Musengezi rear administrative base in Rhodesia to do an airstrike, and the SAS were basically relying on it to frighten the enemy away rather than for any damage it could inflict
To add to the SAS’s troubles, there were also the deadly anti-personnel land mines liberally sown around the countryside, which opened up an entirely new dimension in the war for them.
The bush was extremely thick and often there was no option but to use the few overgrown tracks that there were. Every soldier knew that with each step he took he ran the risk of having a leg blown off.
It was not conducive to good nerves and enemy AP mines claimed two SAS lives before the _Macombe Days_ were over. Thereafter the SAS had very good cause to have a healthy respect for AP mines. The SAS occasionally laid AP mines themselves, but some men were totally against using them at all unless they could be absolutely certain the enemy would walk on them straight away.
For the AP mine was a double-edged sword that could claim Rhodesian lives, especially if planted in a remote area on the off chance of scoring a hit. Often they were planted in the dead of night and the operator might not know exactly where he was, making it difficult to keep an accurate log.
The SAS were often tasked to go back into the same area weeks, months or even years later, running the risk of blowing themselves up on their own mines.
The extremely rugged mountainous terrain north of the river made patrolling over long distances carrying extremely heavy packs, particularly tortuous. The merciless blistering heat, bathing every operator in sweat during the long summer months and the torrential tropical downpours during the rainy season, only added to their discomfort.
Virtually every soldier experienced enormous weight losses on each hush trip. Some lost more than nine kilograms (24lb), a situation made worse by their meagre diet.
Being run-down made them particularly susceptible to veld sores. The exceptionally cruel African bush with most trees, bushes and creepers harboring vicious thorns, took its toll.
Even the grass was an enemy and cut into them. In normal circumstances, minor cuts and scratches could be ignored, but the SAS had to meticulously paint theirs with antiseptic as they could very quickly become septic and develop into runny bush sores which were impossible to heal. Many SAS men still carry the scars from those as a reminder of the rugged _Macombe Days_.
There were perpetual problems with malaria-carrying mosquitoes, which were the most concentrated they were ever to experience. Despite religiously taking antimalarial tablets, men still went down with malaria.
Water had to be constantly purified with tablets to prevent the particularly unpleasant intestinal disease, bilharzia. Other diseases, long since forgotten by the civilized world - cholera, typhoid, blackwater fever - were still common in those areas. Often troops returning from long bush trips would go down with diseases the doctors were unable to classify.
Once they were in the bush, they were in, and would only get casevacked if seriously injured.
The terrain was wild, with thick bush and reeds, and often nil visibility. It was just bush, bush and more bush, with few signs of life; less of civilization. Mist hung along the riverlines, and low clouds clung to the mountains and huge rock kopjes, often making resupply difficult
It was like being transported back in time to an Africa of hundreds or years before, except now there were few wild animals, as many had been killed by FRELIMO and ZANLA.
There were no telegraph poles or roads leading anywhere and the few tracks they came across were overgrown, and the hardly distinguishable foot paths were often criss-crossed with hundreds of felled trees, chopped down by FRELIMO to stop the Portuguese convoys traveling the countryside.
South of the river, there were the occasional cut lines gouged out of the bush years before by the Portuguese in their anti-tsetse campaign.
The enemy were not only ZANLA, but the locals too, and the SAS soon learned to steer well clear of civilians, who invariably reported their presence to FRELIMO.
For even though the SAS donned camouflage cream and appeared as black as the enemy, they could not pass close examination. And even if they did the locals generally knew everyone in the area and reported them anyway.
The SAS’s bushwork quickly developed and became superb.
Every man was alert to the possibility of a hostile civilian, FRELIMO or ZANLA watching through the thick bush, and the little things that could give the enemy away - the crackle of twigs ... scuffling noises which sounded like baboons but without the familiar chatter. . . the sudden noise as a flock of birds flew off and turned into the sun ... even an eerie feeling that told them something was not quite right ... the seeping of water into fresh spoor, and the feeling that hit them in the pits of their stomachs that they were about to walk into an ambush...
Or the times when, in their search for terrorists, they investigated track patterns picked up in the thick bush by aerial reconnaissance ... when the tracks led them through dark, narrow tunnels of undergrowth and the hairs stood up on the backs of their necks. Times when they couldn’t go left or right, they could only go one way, and with every step they took they could lose a leg on an anti-personnel mine, or every corner they turned they could be met by a hail of machinegun rounds and have their heads blown away.
They learned not to linger too long in one place; not to base up for the night in the same spot where they had eaten their last meal of the day; not to take the presence of even a solitary herdboy for granted…
Tactics which they had learned back in Rhodesia suddenly took on new meaning; for now the war games were for real and from the moment they leapt out of the Dakotas they were in enemy territory, in unknown country, and there could be no relaxing until they got back over the border again.
They always spoke in a whisper and only when necessary. They might well have been on a long bush trip in the company of a lot of other soldiers, but they would only exchange a few words with them the entire stint.
When they took a smoke break, there could be no sitting in little groups chatting about this and that. One man would always go forward to watch the front and the last one would face the opposite direction to cover their spoor. The others would face outwards, so the patrol was facing the four points of the compass.
It was during the _Macombe Days_ that Brian Robinson introduced what was for Rhodesia the fairly revolutionary idea of reducing callsigns from six-man to four-man groups to enable them to cover more ground, and to make them more acceptable as an Alouette load.
Initially, there was a considerable amount of determined resistance from the troop commanders, tough courageous men, who thought that it was a ridiculous idea, and that their commander was sending them to certain death. With the smallest FRELIMO group being thirty-strong, there was certainly good reason for the troops to feel apprehensive.
But Brian was merely getting them thinking along traditional SAS lines, and eventually, his men saw the sense of the four-man call sign and realized it was ideal for the _shoot-’n’-scoot_ hunter/killer tactic. 11 was a concept that was to be used with lethal effect from the _Macombe Days_ right until the last days of the war.
The Portuguese were still allowing the Rhodesians only a limited time in Mozambique, but the SAS always managed to find an excuse for staying in - they had found new tracks or had killed a few terrorists - and each time the Portuguese extended their visit.
The attitude of the Portuguese troops to the war had not improved and the SAS were amazed to find that there were Portuguese garrisons and heavily populated aldeamentos not ten kilometres (six miles) from FRELIMO camps. It was not so much as if the Portuguese security forces were condoning the presence of FRELIMO; just that they were not interested in them.
The SAS soon realised that if they told the portuguese they were going to attack a terronst camp, there would be a wink and a nod from the portuguese and ZANLA and FRELIMO would be gone by the time the SAS hit it. In the end the SAS, having learned their lesson, didn’t bother to tell the portuguese. That way, they got results.
After one particularly successful ambush, the SAS made their way into an aldeamento at Mucamgodzi, which had an exact duplicate of a French Foreign legion tower with a crenelated top. After the endless bush and the rugged largely unpopulated terrain, it felt as if they had arrived in London, so great was the Contrast.
The white Mayor of Mucamgodzi, half a dozen portuguese troops and thirty-odd black militia saw them coming and turned out to greet them, treating them like the heroes they were.
They gave the SAS soap and towels to rid themselves of the grime of their weeks of patrolling and laid on a huge feast of fish, rice, vegetables and cold beer. The SAS ere to find on frequent return trips, that the mayor and his friends would invariably break open their last bottle of beer for them.
The Mayor was the first to appreciate that while he and his militia stayed within the safety of their aldeamento, the SAS were out and about in the heavily-mined roads and enemy-infested bush doing their job for them.
During the SAS’s occupation of Macombe aldeamento, it weathered many a storm including floods, occupation by millions of mosquitoes and two terrorist attacks. After the SAS pulled out, it was engulfed by the waters of the giant Cabora Bassa man-made lake.
Then, an event took place in far-away Lisbon which was destined to change the face of Africa and have a very dramatic effect on the Rhodesian war.
It began with a book written by General Antonia de Spinola, who maintained that Portugal could not win its African wars by military means and that only a political solution could end the troubles in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau.
The Portuguese had grown war-weary and the long fight had cost them more than 7 600 lives, many of them national serviceman, who had no link whatsoever with the overseas provinces. The cost of the war was staggering and had affected the economy of Portugal, one of the poorest countries in Europe.
The book triggered a left-wing revolution in Portugal and on April 25, 1974. Dr Marcella Caetano’s Government was overthrown in a military coup d’état… the only time a European army revolted against the retention of colonial rule.
Spinola’s idea of a political solution fell short of total independence, Instead, he advocated some form of federation. But within three months, he changed his tune and began talking of transferring power to the people of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau.
Four hundred years of Portuguese rule was all but over. Ironically, it happened at a stage when the Portuguese Army was containing the terrorist problem in Angola, and starting to gain the upper hand in Mozambique.
Even before there was talk of transferring power to the nationalists, the portuguese Army collapsed in the three provinces.
The black nationalist group FRELlMO came to power in Mozambique, while in Angola, the pro-Soviet People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) would emerge the victor in the civil war that followed the Portuguese collapse.
Power was transferred to FRELIMO in June, 1975, something which even in their wildest dreams they had not anticipated happening for another ten years. Even before then, however, they were seen around the towns and formed a transitional government in October, 1974. The Portuguese streamed out of the country in droves … and a new era began.
For beleaguered Rhodesia, the fall of the Portuguese administration represented a strategic nightmare. Overnight, it meant that the whole of the exposed eastern border adjoining Mozambique - Some 1 100 kilometres (680 miles) of it - suddenly became very vulnerable.
Apart from a 200 kilometres (125 mile) stretch bordering friendly South Africa at the Limpopo River, Rhodesians, always short of manpower, now had an enormous 3000 kilometres (1 800 miles) of hostile border to guard, and over which the enemy would eventually pour from every angle.
The country’s import and export lifeline which carried most of Rhodesia’s sanctions breaking oil supplies from the east coast ports of Beira and Lourenco Marques (Maputo) now ran through a country which was dedicated to the overthrow of white-ruled Rhodesia.
It would be two years before FRELIMO leader Samora Machel closed the border with Rhodesia thereby severing her links with Mozambique ports, but by then, having anticipated such an event, Rhodesia would have a new rail link, a single economic artery, from Rutenga in south-east Rhodesia to Beitbridge and on to Johannesburg. The 145 kilometres (90 miles) of rail line took just 93 days to lay and was finished 21 months ahead of schedule.
White-ruled Rhodesia, virtually surrounded by black Botswana, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique, and already isolated by international sanctions, was now even more dependent on “Big Brother” down south.
The SAS withdrew from Mozambique immediately news of the Lisbon coup became known, but went right back in again the next day. They would never need permission again.
Now more than ever before, they needed to monitor and kill as many terrorists as they could. With FRELIMO in power, it would not be long before ZANLA took advantage of the situation and opened up new sectors enabling them to infiltrate into Rhodesia on a wide front.
Ultimately, ZANLA would abandon their bases in Zambia and move their entire operation into Mozambique to direct their infiltrations from the east. (This followed the assassination of ZANLA Operations Chief, Herbert Chitepo by a car bomb, said to have been the work of fellow ZANLA but probably planted at the instigation of Rhodesian security forces. Several ZANLA were rounded up and imprisoned, including a member of the high command, Josiah Tongogara. As a result, the war was brought to a virtual standstill.)
Logistical supplies would be more readily available because of air and sea routes, and as road transport was available, greater quantities of material could be moved more readily.
Newly trained personnel would not have to walk vast distances and could be transported directly to crossing points. There was not such a desperate need to rely on porters, and medical treatment would not be far away, which would do wonders for morale. The psychological impact of the portuguese _coup d’état_ would also turn the trickle of recruits into a flood.
In November, 1974, there was talk of detente and in keeping with the spirit of the exercise, the SAS were pulled out of Mozambique.
While the unit had already stopped using Macombe base, it was the end of the _Macombe Days_ era. A lot of invaluable soldiering lessons had been learned, which would stand the men in good stead for the many hazardous operations that were to follow.
