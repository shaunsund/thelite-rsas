For some time, a ZIPRA reconnaissance platoon had been basing up on the northern shores of Lake Kariba, crossing over into Rhodesia to gather intelligence, then returning to their sanctuary in Zambia. .
Special Branch knew they used a house close to the lake shore as their headquarters and staging point, but for some time they could not pin it down. Then they eventually got lucky and the house was located at an isolated spot on the lake shore at a place called Chipepo. Originally a civilian fishing cottage, it went by the name of the Chipepo Guest House. .
There were the usual scatterings of locals’ huts in the area, but the guest house itself was several hundred metres from the nearest habitation.
The missing piece of the jigsaw slotted in while the SAS’s “A” Troop were operating from Weather Island, eighty kilometres (fifty miles) west of Kariba village. Lieutenant Bob McKenna and his men had already spent three exhausting days along the Zambian shoreline searching for ZIPRA crossing points. They were able to locale one and, as an added bonus, unearthed a two metre-deep supply bunker. ZIPRA had failed to booby-trap their bunker, so the SAS climbed down and did it for them! .
Their mission over, the weary men climbed back in their boats, set sail for Rhodesian waters and began looking forward to a well-earned sleep. But there was to be no sleep for them that night. Waiting to greet them back on Weather Island was the SAS 2IC, Mick Graham, with the news that they would be out on the lake again that night. .
Chipepo Guest House was about to get some uninvited visitors and an attack was to be mounted immediately, before the ZIPRA men could be alerted and make good their escape. .
The plan called for the raiding party to spring their attack on the house early in the evening, when the terrorists were off guard ... capture everyone inside ... and return to Rhodesia before first light. .
Up-to-date intelligence given by any captures could only prove useful to the Rhodesians - and might very well lead to other operations being mounted - so the aim of the mission was to bring back prisoners, Mick Graham told Bob McKenna who would be commanding the actual attack.
Taking prisoners would be a severe tactical handicap and Bob set about working out a plan of action. Perhaps they could surround the house and get in without firing any shots? Then again, maybe they would be able to capture the enemy while they were asleep.
Just after dark, 16 blackened-up SAS men climbed aboard a security force command boat and two inflatable rubber motor boats, and set sail for Zambia. On the command boat were six canoes to use on the last stretch of the journey.
They sped across the vast expanse of water separating the two countries, but a navigational error was made and by the time the boats neared the Zambian shoreline it was close on midnight.
The command boat and the two rubber boats cut their engines and the 12-man raiding party disembarked, climbed into the six canoes and paddled into the night. Their four friends were to wait for them out on the lake ... to pick them up when their mission was over or to speed to their rescue if there was a problem.
There was a very bright moon that night and the canoeists could only hope there would be no locals, fishermen or enemy up and about by the water’s edge to see their silent approach.
The only noise that could be heard was from the water as it gently lapped against their paddles.
Cautiously, the 12 men approached the shoreline. It was now getting on for 01h00. Surely everyone would have long ago gone to bed? .
As they put in to shore, they saw no sign of life. The terrain was as they had imagined it ... typically open, with just a few trees dotted here and there.
Immediately in front of them, well-illuminated in the eerie stillness of the moonlit night for all the uninvited visitors to see, was their target - the Chipepo Guest House. It was of brick construction with a corrugated iron roof, and just 150 metres from the water’s edge. .
Leaving the canoes on the beach, the dozen shadowy figures silently moved up to the house.
Bob whispered to his men to take up their positions around the building. Soon, the ZIPRA headquarters was completely encircled with well-armed SAS men. Bob went up to the front door. It was time to try out his first plan.
He intended walking straight in to see what was going on, then take things from there. He turned the handle, but, contrary to the locals’ practice, the ZIPRA platoon had taken the precaution of locking it. .
It was time for Plan B. .
The sound of knocking thundered through the guest house. It was certainly an unearthly hour to go visiting. It was followed immediately by the unmistakable sound of a white man, and an American one at that, as he bellowed: .
“COME OUT AND GIVE YOURSELVES UP.  WE’VE GOT YOU SURROUNDED ... THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT OF THE WINDOWS ... COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP AND WE WON’T HARM YOU.” .
With that, there was a great clattering from inside, as the startled ZIPRA began cocking their AKs. Bob decided to give it one more go. .
“COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP ... WE WONT HARM YOU” .
But the men inside plainly did not believe the last part of the instruction firing rounds out of the windows all around the house and through door. .
Then Bob did the movie trick of shooting at the lock He fired about 15 rounds at it, but still the lock did not budge. .
By now the terrorists had begun heaving grenades out of the window. Time for Plan C. .
Around about this time, Bob was resolving that the capture of prisoners  simply have to be a lucky by-product of the mission, not the aim. .
However, they still would not use maximum force just yet. He was hope still be possible to get something in the way of a capture. .
“GRENADES!” he shouted to his team … and high explosive phosphorus grenades were thrown through the windows, and a volley of rifle fire put down. .
Occasionally, ZIPRA would lob a grenade out of the windows, sending men lurking below, dashing away. They would wait for it to go off ... then. they would return to take up their positions beneath the windows. .
Flames begun by the white phosphorus and tracers started to lick th Inside, Choking white smoke filled the house. .
The terrorists were putting up a determined resistance … and the SAS side were relentlessly keeping up their attack. .
Then the burning began to get out of hand. The blaze had quickly spread room to the next. As flames leapt ever-nearer to the enemy they were force safety, seeking sanctuary in one room at the corner of the house. .
With the flames getting closer and the house surrounded, the terrorists were finally cornered. .
The room they were confined to had two windows, one on one corner, one on the other. Shots continued to smack both in and out of both windows as the enemies fought it out. .
The SAS commander still had it in mind to get his prisoners, yet he c them to bum in the process. .
“GET SOME WATER AND PUT THAT FIRE OUT,” he yelled to some of his troops above the noise of shooting, crackling flames and crashing masonry. .
Grabbing pots, ammunition tins and whatever containers they could find, the water party hurried down to the lake. They were soon back and set about attempting to douse the blaze. .
“GRENADES!” the lieutenant ordered again to the troops positioned at the two windows. .
And while some of his men followed that order, the others continued to subdue the flames. .
Eventually after many trips to the water’s edge, the fire was extinguished …but a pall of heavy black smoke filled the house and hung in the air. .
And still the enemy were nowhere near surrendering. Inside the smouldering house they were scheming new moves. .
Suddenly, there was a long burst of bullets from one of the windows: then a grenade was thrown out. .
It almost landed on Bob’s foot, but he and his men had seen it coming and again they ran around the side of the house to take cover. .
As the grenade exploded, three ZIPRA leapt from the windows and made a break for it, trying to get away under the cover of the pall of smoke from the house fire and from that kicked up by the exploding grenade. .
They ran for their lives through the dense choking smoke, chased by a merciless hail of bullets. .
So thick was the smoke that the soldiers could not tell if they had shot any of the ZIPRA men or not. But judging from the appalling odour wafting through the cordite-filled air that morning, they knew that at least one man had taken a hit in the guts. .
Bob McKenna mentally gave the fleeing men full marks. They had obviously sorted out their escape quite well and executed it without it being a complete failure. .
But he was rapidly losing patience with the order about having to capture the enemy, and was now thinking of other measures. .
They still had not got that front door open and once more they turned their attention to it. .
Again Bob tried the other Hollywood trick of trying to kick the door in with his boot Again it failed to work. Eventually, a strongly-built trooper pushed him out of the way. “Allow me, sir ... ,” he mumbled. .
The trooper moved back slightly and paused for a moment. Then he hurtled forward and took a flying rugby tackle at the door, whereupon it fell straight in with the trooper still lying on top of it, and Bob standing over him. .
They were confronted with the spectre of a man on his hands and knees and glowing in the darkness. He shone like a human torch from all the white phosphorus that covered his entire body. .
As the door crashed down, the wounded man threw out a grenade and it rolled between the SAS lieutenant and the trooper. As it did so, a burst of rifle fire from Bob McKenna’s FN thumped into the glowing enemy and he fell dead before them. But the grenade continued rolling on its way coming to a sickening halt right at the two soldiers’ feet. .
There was no time to take cover. The worried pair could only wait for it to go off. But nothing happened. .
Then they realised that although the injured enemy had the presence of mind to heave a grenade at his attackers, he was so badly wounded that he had not had the strength to pull out the pin. Someone was definitely looking after them that night, and the two men offered up a silent prayer. .
They stepped over the bleeding, still-glowing terrorist and cautiously moved into the smouldering headquarters. .
Swiftly, silently, they checked out the blackened rooms, establishing that the glowing ZIPRA had been the last one alive in the house. One man lay dead under a bed: the others had cleverly escaped through the window and run off into the night. Having missed their men, they grabbed every document and it made quite a reasonable haul and would no doubt prove very useful to SB.
By now the unchecked flames had spread and the house was again starting to burn furiously.
Bob glanced at his watch. Time was going. They checked out the area around the guest house in the hope of finding any wounded, but there was no sign.
Bob got on the radio to Mick Graham waiting out on the lake to put him in the picture; together with the request to come and collect them. The boats sped in for the pick-up.
The captured kit and their six canoes were loaded on to the boats. One hour before daylight, the raiding party climbed aboard and left Chipepo.
Behind them flames shot high against the greying early-morning sky as the guest house continued to blaze. When the fire spread to the armoury it took on new dimensions as landmines, rockets and rounds began exploding, and brilliant flashes fuelled the flames.
As for the men responsible, they had no sooner got clear of the bay than their problems began. A storm had blown up while they were dealing with the guest house, and soon one of the engines of the main boat began to give trouble as they ploughed into the howling wind and wild waves making almost no headway. However, the motors in the two smaller boats were running reliably and they were faring a bit better.
An urgent signal was sent out over the savage waters of the lake, telling of their problems and requesting immediate help.
When daylight dawned, they were still inside Zambian waters and feeling slightly uneasy.
They continued battling into the storm. Then the command boat ran out of fuel and the passengers were left adrift. .
Soon afterwards, the distinctive, welcoming whirr of a Rhodesian helicopter could be heard approaching in answer to their earlier call for help.
The chopper lowered fuel to the main boat and the two motor boats alongside. But the problem with the bigger boat’s engine still remained.
“YOU’D BETTER GO ON AS BEST YOU CAN,” 2IC Mick Graham yelled to make himself heard above the din of the storm to the men in the two smaller craft. .
Left behind on the main boat were Mick Graham, Bob McKenna, mechanic Tex Wills and a few of the troops. Tex got the motor going, while the chopper pilot lowered a rope to take the boat in tow.
But as the boat bobbed up on a monstrous wave it almost smashed into the bottom of the chopper ... and when it dipped into another trough, it dragged the chopper down with it. The chopper came within centimetres of crashing into them and plummeting into the angry black waters of the lake.
Everyone agreed the helicopter trick was not a good idea and cut the chopper loose.
With a friendly wave from the relieved pilot, the chopper flew home, leaving the soldiers to continue their battle with the storm with one engine working and the other struggling.
Then, just as they reckoned they had arrived in friendly waters, they saw a large Rhodesian boat in the distance, and immediately began firing rockets to attract the driver’s attention.
Across the spray and the turbulent waters, the driver, a Police Reservist, saw coloured flashes dart across the sky.
To the SAS’s relief he roared in for the rescue. He did not seem in the least bit surprised to find a team of heavily armed, blackened-up soldiers returning from the Zambian Side of the lake and without so much as an explanation from them, he promptly towed them back to their base on Weather Island.
Bob McKenna was pleased with their haul of documents but he silently vowed that this would be the last time he would ever accept an order where the capture of prisoners was the _sole_ aim of the mission.
A ZIPRA, Sporting scars from white phosphorus bums would one day tell SB how he and another wounded and burnt colleague had managed to escape from Chipepo House and lived to tell the tale. The third man had been killed, and they had carried him away under cover of the pall of choking smoke.
