Within a few months of UDI. twenty-one ZANU had infiltrated Rhodesia from Zambia, then split into three sections. One group headed for Umtali in an abortive bid to blow up the Beira-Umtali oil pipeline and kill white farmers, and a second group headed for Fort Victoria. Both were rounded up.
The third group was chased by 120 police and reservists in the biggest counter terrorist operation the country had seen. They infiltrated 250 kilometres (155 miles) into Rhodesia and reached Sinoia some 120 kilometres (74 miles) from Salisbury.  
An informer working for the Rhodesian Special Branch had infiltrated the gang and managed to slip away from his comrades to tip of the police … and on April 29, the net tightened, a fierce battle ensued - and seven insurgents, some trained at the Nanking Military College near Peking, were killed.  
The battle had been nothing more than a fiasco for the terrorists, but it had been the deepest penetration into Rhodesia to date and ZANU would mark it as the first day of their war of liberation, their _Chimurenga_ Day.

But for many people, however, the real war began three weeks later when a white farmer and his wife, Johannes and Barbara Viljoen, answered a knock at the door of their remote farmhouse 25 kilometres (15 miles) from Hartley and armed men began shouting at them.  
“Then Mummy and Daddy lay down and went to sleep on the floor,” their young son told police. The Viljoens were the first Rhodesians to die at the hands of Communist-trained and armed terrorists.  
As for the SAS, they planned to put things right and their first external operations into Zambia began.  
Top secrecy was clamped on the missions and so sensitive were they that only the Army Commander, General R.R.J. Putterill, the Director of the Central Intelligence Organization - an umbrella agency handling internal and external intelligence - Ken Flower and the SAS Commander, were briefed about them.  
As the unit was run by the senior NCOs, it was obvious they chose to carry out the operations themselves.  
Yet this policy of using the same people each time for clandestine operations, while excellent for security, was very bad for morale. It wasn’t long before the operators were being dubbed _The Secret Seven_ or the _Sinful Seven_ by members who were naturally upset at not having the opportunity of having their crack at special operations.  
Not only did it cause a great deal of unhappiness throughout the unit, but as it involved the most experienced operators, it was also putting all their eggs in one basket.  
Then in October 1966, the SAS commander, together with W.O. II Bob Bouch, Colour Sergeant Mick Cahill and Colour Sergeant Geordie Wright and a policeman seconded to the unit for the operation, Chief Superintendent John Wickenden, formed the team chosen to travel to Lusaka, the Zambian capital where they were to destroy the ZANU headquarters.  
Sergeant Jannie Boltman was to have been included in the party. He had been in on all the rehearsals, but the op had been cancelled a number of times and eventually Jannie decided he had to take his annual holiday. His place was taken by Geordie Wright.  
The plan was to cross the Zambezi just below the Chirundu Bridge by canoe. The explosive device, which had been made up in Salisbury, was transported to Chirundu by vehicle. Then the collapsible canoes and the explosive device were portered to the crossing point  
The five men began assembling the canoes and making the final preparations. The SAS commander, moved away from the others for a moment and began to tie his bootlace.  
Just as the commander bent down, a terrific explosion tore through the air. The explosive device had accidentally detonated and the SAS commander was knocked unconscious.  
He came to with his hair alight and both ear drums perforated ... and the scene that greeted him was not a pretty one. Bob Bouch, Mick Cahill and John Wickenden were dead. Geordie Wright was still alive but it was obvious there was no hope for him and he died in his commander’s arms.  
The cream of the unit had been brutally wiped out, and, but for the protection of a fold in the ground, the SAS commander would have also died that day.  
Nearly two kilometres away at Chirundu police camp, Sergeant Major Al Tourle of the RLI, with his commando on border patrol duty, heard the explosion. He had no forewarning about the operation and was more than a little surprised when the explosion rumbled across the countryside.  
As he rushed down to the river’s edge to find out what had happened, he bumped into the survivor on his way up from the Zambezi in search of help.  
“Hullo, Sergeant Major, how are you?” the SAS commander asked in his normal calm, cultured lone, not sounding at all like a man who had just escaped death by a miracle. Nothing, it seemed, could rattle the SAS man.  
The remains of the bodies were collected next day and soon after first light, a Rhodesian Air Force chopper arrived to transport the OC and the bodies back to Salisbury.  
The chopper reached the height of 100 feet and then just to round out the whole thing, the engine cut out. The pilot executed a very professional auto rotation crash-landing which saved the SAS commander and a precious helicopter.  
The commander stepped out of the aircraft, brushed his handle-bar mustache and contemplated what was to happen to him next!  
The cause of the explosion was never discovered. The device was prepared with a built-in time mechanism and it can only be assumed that the vehicle trip must have damaged or unseated this mechanism. It was a very expensive way of finding out that initiating devices should only be placed in a charge when at the target. But in those early days of the war all Rhodesians were inexperienced in this type of operation and they did not know any better.  
The day after the tragedy. the SAS were lined up and told of the deaths. The men were stunned. Jannie Boltman, who by rights should have been on the mission, was especially shocked.  
The four men were awarded posthumous Meritorious Conduct Medals. It was Geordie Wright’s second tribute to his bravery.  
Six months earlier, he had been on duly at Kariba Power Station when the peace of the afternoon was shattered by an explosion. An African civilian had climbed over the bilingual warning notice and the double fence surrounding a minefield near the power station and had stood on a mine. Now the man lay bleeding and groaning in the middle of the field.  
Geordie immediately volunteered to go in and get the injured man, but was advised to wait until they could get hold of the plans showing exactly where the mines were planted.  
Geordie could see the sense of that and waited - and waited. Thirty minutes ticked by and the sound of moaning drifted across to the SAS men on the other side of the fence, yet still the plans had not materialized.  
Geordie decided he could wait no longer and scaled the minefield fence, unaware of exactly where the mines were planted. Using his bayonet, he probed a path through the minefield, inching his way forward until he reached the injured man.  
Then, after retracing his path to the protective fence, he re-entered the minefield with a stretcher and together with Lieutenant Harry Harvey returned to the casualty and carried him to safety.  
The prompt action of Geordie and Harry Harvey, undoubtedly saved the life of the man. and both SAS men were awarded a Commendation for Brave Conduct.
