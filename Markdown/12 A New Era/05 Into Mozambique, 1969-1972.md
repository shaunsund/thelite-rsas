Up until the late sixties and early seventies, guerrilla incursions into Rhodesia were not militarily successful for a variety of reasons.
A very real factor was the vigilance by security forces and other government departments in the Zambezi Valley, The farmers too, who in the main were members of the Police Reserve and had the benefit of training programs, were a force to be reckoned with.
The few large-scale incursions there had been had left the terrorists severely mauled by the security forces. The Zambezi had indeed become a valley of death.
Then in 1967 ZIPRA made a political blunder when they infiltrated with the South African ANC (African National Congress). Pretoria immediately dispatched a number of policemen to strengthen Rhodesia’s security. They became more involved from the following year and were to stay patrolling the Valley until 1975.
A massive incursion took place in 1968 and the six-week operation, codenamed _Cauldron_, lasted six weeks and involved the amy, air force and police. During the operation, the SAS picked up a thoroughly emaciated insurgent who hadn’t had a drop to drink or anything to eat for ten days. They gave him a packet of Army “dog biscuits” which he ate - and to their utter amazement, dropped stone dead at their feet. Next day, Captain Brian Robinson sent a signal to the Quartermasters’ Stores congratulating them on their first kill!
Smaller urban groups had penetrated Rhodesia intent on striking at the heart of the country’s administration, but in the main, although a few explosive devices were detonated, the impact was negligible and the police were able to deal with the matter.
The enormous hardships encountered by groups in the Zambezi Valley was another very real deterrent and gave the defender an advantage.
The Zambezi River and Lake Kariba were natural barriers that had to be crossed. The valley was extremely hot; there was disease and little water, And there was no one to give them food, shelter and intelligence.
Insurgents would cross the Zambezi loaded down with ammunition and those who did not drop dead through lack of water, had the stuffing knocked out of them by the security forces, while others failed the river crossing attempting to escape. South of the river were high bare hills, ravines and a vast expanse of open bush. It was a good thirty days’ journey from Zambia before a man could gel into action against a reasonable target; another thirty days back to get an ammunition resupply.
Infiltrators also made the basic errors which in insurgency led to certain death. They moved in columns. wore green fatigues and a standardized boot with a distinctive pattern which made tracking easy.
The Rhodesians’ intelligence network was excellent and continually had the nationalists guessing.
Political strife within the two opposing factions of ZANU and ZAPU did not help their plans to take Rhodesia through the barrel of the gun, either. Neither did their initial lack of recruits.
In the early days of the war, only one country could really be used as a springboard for incursions and that was Zambia. Although Botswana was used in a limited way, Zambia was the only liberated country to share a frontier with Rhodesia where large concentrations of men could be assembled.
To the east was Portuguese-ruled Mozambique. which meant a hostile passage for the terrorists. But time and history were destined to change all that.

There was an airline advertisement which regularly told Rhodesian television audiences of the delights of a Mozambican coastal holiday. “The Portuguese have been there a long time,” it said, as it showed fleeting visions of sand, sea and platters piled high with seafood.
Whether by air or by the long tortuous road leading eastwards, landlocked Rhodesians would flock to Beira or Lourenco Marques (later known as Maputo) and were particularly lemming-like at long weekends in their quest for prawns and cheap vino.
Yet there was another face to Mozambique and it was not tourism that concerned others in the country ... they were interested in severing Metropolitan Portugal’s 400 year-old rule on its far-flung African Province.
They were members of the black nationalist movement FRELIMO (The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique); they wanted black majority rule and were deter- mined to get it by armed struggle. The war, which had begun in the early sixties, had become increasingly bitter and FRELIMO were having a fair amount of success.
Prior to FRELIMO beginning its campaign to oust the Portuguese, the Mozambique Province had been the perfect overseas posting for Portuguese Army officers who generally hailed from high-class families. The main concentration of inhabitants stretched along almost one-third of the East African coast and the officers joined them for a fine life under the African sun.
But then things began to go sour. FRELIMO started making their presence felt about the countryside and Mozambique very rapidly lost its appeal - many high-ranking officers packed their bags and returned to the safety of Portugal.
To counter the growing problems in Mozambique, the Portuguese shipped out the povo - the peasants - men who had not been made welcome there before, and, as it was generally a conscript army, morale was not good.
In March 1968, FRELIMO opened up the Tete front in the east, adjoining Zambia. Malawi and Rhodesia. and in 1969 an SAS tracker team was asked togo into Mozambique to hunt down FRELIMO for the Portuguese.
They were the first white Rhodesian soldiers to go into Mozambique and their presence there was top secret FRELIMO had not yet forced their way south across the Zambezi River, and the SAS teams operated right to the extreme north of the country near the Malawi/Zambia/Mozambican borders.
But the Portuguese were extremely loath to come out of their garrison camps. Their hearts were simply not in the war, and with a few notable exceptions, they generally only wanted to get back to Portugal in one piece.
Junior officers and NCOs objected to being pulled out of university for three years and sent to Africa to fight for people who were important in Mozambique but would be of no consequence back home.
On the rare occasions they did venture out of their garrisons, they did so in strength, and were not prepared to break into smaller groups where they stood the chance of greater success.
Their discipline left much to be desired, and their standard drill when getting lost in the bush was to fire shots in the air!
Often to the horror of the SAS trackers closing in on fresh spoor for them, the Portuguese would break open beer cans and start drinking ... or bang tins or planks to deliberately frighten the enemy away. Most of the contacts the SAS trackers had turned into running punch-ups.
When the Rhodesians located an enemy camp for them, the Portuguese would often do a dry run with their jets. Then they would do the real thing the next day. By then, of course, FRELIMO had fled.
But apart from giving the Portuguese a hand the SAS men did gain a knowledge of the terrain. And the exercise gave them battle experience that proved useful in later years when their own war got into full swing.
Then, in 1970, FRELIMO conducted a large offensive and managed to cross the Zambezi River near Chicoa. It was a decisive phase in Mozambique’s war and it opened up Mozambique from the Zambezi River down Rhodesia’s north- eastern border.
But Portuguese forces were stretched. This predicament ensured the unimpeded progress of FRELIMO and ultimately their complete dominance of that part of Mozambique.
The Rhodesians - the SAS, RLI and Air Force - were naturally eager to keep FRELIMO away from their own border and prevent the war spilling into their own country, so they carried out a classic combined operation with the Portuguese. Even at this early stage, the security forces were concerned that Rhodesian terrorists might piggy-back on FRELIMO routes.
They aimed to show the Portuguese both the tracking concept and the joint-operations concept of counter-insurgency warfare where air and land operations were integrated. Yet when it came to tracking, it was the Rhodesians who were to learn the biggest lessons.
Up until then, they had viewed tracking as the magic ingredient for success. Their own victories had been in the remote, unpopulated regions of the Zambezi Valley where, if there was no interference from the rain, tracks would remain for any thing up to a week.
They soon found that tracking was an entirely different proposition in a heavily-populated area where it was pouring with rain the whole time. It was the first indication to the Rhodesians that should things go wrong and the war be taken to the population, they too would have similar problems.
They were not to know it then, but by the time their own war got into full swing, the need for tracking would virtually fall away. There would be so many enemy running around Rhodesia that there would be no need to track them down; and there would not be enough trackers to do the job anyway.
