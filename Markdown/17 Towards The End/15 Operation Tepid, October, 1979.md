The situation in Zambia had now changed drastically, and intelligence was continuing to come in about the training of regular conventional terrorists and the formation of conventional battalions and brigades.  
There were thus two distinct brands of ZIPRA who were entirely different from each other- the unconventional irregular guerrillas, and the regulars trained in classical warfare.  
Early in the year during a helicopter extraction, a number of choppers were fired at from a location about sixty kilometres (37 miles) south-west of Chirundu. The area was marked by the pilots and later a photographic reconnaissance mission was flown by a Canberra from 5 Squadron.  
Interpreting the photographs proved a very difficult task. Unfortunately, when the sortie was flown, the haze was so bad that the 3-D effect essential for a clear and accurate interpretation was lost. The photographs therefore appeared totally fiat, making it difficult to pick up areas of dense jesse bush, ideal for affording the enemy cover.  
The fact that it was October and the height of the dry season did not help either. Everything was brown anyway, and from the air the jesse tended to blend in closely with the colour of the ground.  
The area under scrutiny was around Lusuto, 21 kilometres (13 miles) north-west of Siavonga on the Zambian side ofLake Kariba and seventy kilometres (43 miles) from Kariba. The Rhodesians were particularly interested in two ridges astride a large salt pan. And after many long hours of studying the photographs, the interpreters eventually fathomed out the story.  
On the low ground to the north and south of two ridges and in the pan area itself and near the waterlines, there were areas of dense vegetation and very thick jesse bush.  
There was also some vegetation and tree cover on the smaller, the most western, of the two ridges.  
On the other ridge, the bigger of the two, the eastern side was covered with sparse vegetation. However, it was so open that it was the most unlikely spot for the enemy to be based up in. ZIPRA normally chose areas of dense tree cover to protect them from Rhodesia’s eyes in the sky.  
There was no evidence either of track patterns worn in the ground by people walking from one spot to another.  
But then came a stroke of luck. The interpreters began to pick up signs of trenches, and from the number and the way they were sited, it became apparent that this very sparsely vegetated area, a very unlikely hide-out indeed, had to be the position of a conventionally-trained ZIPRA battalion, the first the Rhodesians had pinpointed.  
ZIPRA had learned their lessons well and there were no give-away tracks leading from one trench to another- the occupants had very wisely walked on rocky areas and made use of extremely hard soil.  
And to make life even more difficult for the interpreters, ZIPRA had taken the precaution of camouflaging the bottom of the trenches with soil of the same colour as the surrounding area so there were no differences in soil colouration. Loose stone had also been used to break up outlines.  
But having at long last located one of the elusive enemy battalion positions, the Rhodesians were unable to assess how many people were holed up there, and what weaponry they had.  
Even if there was a full battalion of several hundred troops, numbers did not really mean that much to the Rhodesians. After all, a mere 200 SAS and RLI troops had attacked 10 000-plus at Chimoio-1, and it had been a walk over as the enemy was not inclined to stand and fight.  
To take on a conventional enemy would need heavy support weapons and transporting them was a problem. At least in Mozambique the Rhodesians could drive to the enemy positions. This was not the case in Zambia where the Zambezi separated the two countries. The Rhodesians were entirely reliant on what they could carry across the fiver in choppers, or by para drop.  
Rhodesia simply did not have the necessary resources to attack ZIPRA conventional battalions.  
Rhodesia had already learned several severe lessons about attacking enemy base camp positions which were well-sited and protected, and they were extremely loath to get involved in another major external operation which would end up in much the same way as _Uric_ and _Miracle_.  
But something clearly had to be done to blunt the threat on the northern border.  
ComOps decided the best plan would be to disrupt the positions by double ambushing the roads on the low ground leading to and from the suspected battalion positions to stop anyone going in and coming out.., to cut it off in the middle.., and hope it would be abandoned.  
A bombing run was planned, after which two 16-man SAS fighting patrols would be inserted to watch for any reaction… block the routes in and out… sweep the area ... and, if the opportunity presented itself, return with a suitable capture to provide the Rhodesians with a useful source of intelligence. In the likelihood of trouble, the groups were strong enough to fight off any opposition.  
Bob McKenna’s “C” Squadron got the job and travelled to Kariba to prepare for the op - and on the morning of October 18, under cover of a Hunter and Canberra bombing run, the two separate groups were put down in the area.  
One group, under the command of Lieutenant Rich Stannard, was dropped about 12 kilometres to the north-east of the main ridge and the other, under Lieutenant Phil Brooke, the same distance away to the south-east of the same ridge.  
After the air strike, a Dakota circled the area then flew up one ridge and down the other, dropping incendiaries out of the door from 200 feet in the hope of burning the place out, thus making any ZIPRA there more vulnerable.  
As it was, many of the incendiaries failed to go off, and although the pilot reported seeing trenches, he could not see anyone in them.  
The two SAS fighting patrols could see no reaction either. There was not a single shot fired in retaliation at the jets or the Dakota. In fact, they saw no movement whatsoever, and in the light of such a negative response, a third Hunter strike was cancelled.  
Bob McKenna, too, circling in a Lynx, silently registered the mission as a _lemon_... a pointless exercise. It was obvious the position had been abandoned.  
The two patrols were equally convinced that any enemy who might have been there earlier had already vacated the area.  
Nevertheless, Bob decided the two teams should remain where they were and they hid in the bush hoping it might still be possible to get a capture.  
They stayed for the rest of the day with Rich Stannard and his team on the northeast seeing no sign of any enemy.  
Phil Brooke and his group set up an ambush and they had hardly taken up their positions than one of the early-warning groups came on the radio to warn of a twenty-man enemy sweepline advancing towards the main killer group. The SAS had no option but to engage them. One ZIPRA was killed and the remainder took flight.  
That night, Bob McKenna radioed each of the two groups to press on and sweep towards the top of the ridge. They were to rendezvous at first light then move into the camp and see what, if anything, was going on there. After that, the choppers would come in and take them back to Kariba.  
The bush on the approaches to both sides of the ridge turned out to be incredibly thick and both patrol commanders came to the conclusion that the only way to reach the ridge was to walk on the track. It was a dicey move in any circumstances, but the lack of moon and the nature of the terrain left them with no option.  
However, they took the normal precaution of putting out a scout section in front to lead the way, with the rest of the men walking close behind.  
The incredible heat of the Zambezi Valley at that time of the year, coupled with the walk, resulted in one very severe case of heat fatigue in Phil Brooke’s group. The man could barely walk and he was left behind with a three-man escort while the remaining 12 men continued moving ever-so-carefully towards the suspected camp at the top of the huge ridge.  
Rich Stannard and his team meanwhile were doing the same from the opposite direction. It was a very still night in the valley. There was not a sound to be heard. Quietly, stealthily, the two groups closed in through the darkness.  
Suddenly, Phil Brooke’s group heard the distinctive sound of an AK being put from safe to fire. Then a burst of red tracer arched four metres over their heads.  
“Inanda?” (“Who is it?”) a harsh urgent voice demanded of Phil and his group.  
There could be no replying to the ZIPRA ambush patrol lurking on the side of the track, and the callsign immediately went to ground and tried to move away.  
For a few moments nothing happened. Then it dawned on the enemy that the shadowy figures were not comrades as they had at first thought, and a burst of machinegun fire shattered the night.  
Lance Corporal John McLaurin went down in the initial burst, severely wounded in the stomach by a stray shot  
“Open Fire,” the SAS commander shouted to his men. There were eight RPD light machineguns among the 12 Rhodesians and with the constant heavy rate of fire the SAS was putting down, it was obviously too much for the ZIPRA ambushers.  
They must have thought they had taken on a far larger group, and after a short firefight, they took off for the bush, leaving their weapons, spare magazines and blankets, and dragging a wounded colleague with them. Next morning, Phil and his men would inspect the ambush scene to find the six ZIPRA men had opened up 25 metres from the track. There was blood spoor and from the orderly manner in which they had left their belongings, it was obvious they had been well organised.  
After the firefight, the SAS pulled back 200 metres from the track, doing their best to keep their seriously injured patient quiet.  
Further injuries had been averted but by the narrowest of margins. The patrol had good reason to be thankful for those few precious moments of hesitation when the enemy had mistaken them for ZIPRA.  
Immediately, the troop medic set to work putting up a drip and giving John McLaurin morphine; and a signal was sent to “C” Squadron in Kariba requesting an urgent casualty evacuation.  
But the weather was poor and the moon phase was such that no helicopter support was immediately available… and the callsign stayed in the same spot for the rest of the night without anyone really getting any sleep.  
John McLaurin was wounded at midnight and the unfortunate young soldier eventuaily died five hours later.  
Rich Stannard and his team meanwhile had been pressing on through the night towards the ridge. He had planned to travel all night, but in the early hours he had an uneasy feeling and decided they ought to snatch a couple of hours sleep.  
That morning, after the casevac chopper had arrived on the far side of the ridge to collect the body of John McLaurin and casevac the heat fatigue case, Phil Brooke and his callsign, now convinced ZIPRA had abandoned the position after the previous night’s contact, were choppered forward closer to the main camp area.  
The ridge had a steep gradient with a number of false crests and just as they reached what they thought was the top, so another rise would appear before them. They pressed on up and were almost at the top when all hell was let loose and they were in hot water again.  
For waiting to greet them was a fusillade of very effective and heavy enemy fire, which was controlled, accurate and supplemented by mortars carrying out searching fire.  
But, initially, because of ZIPRA’s excellent trench system, which was superbly camouflaged and because ZIPRA discipline was so good, Phil thought Rich Stannard and his team were unintentionally firing at them from the opposite side of the ridge.  
He immediately reached for his radio and quizzed Rich about the matter. No, replied Rich, it wasn’t them; they couldn’t even hear shooting; it had to be coming from the enemy.  
The SAS fired back, but as soon as they so much as showed themselves over the ridge, they were met by a hail of bullets. Phil and a corporal looked over the ridge, and Phil got a nick in the buttocks for his trouble and the corporal was shot in the arm.  
Phil and his team were up against rifle fire, recoilless rifles, mortars, 12,7 millimetre and 14,5 millimetre heavy weapons and were thoroughly pinned down.  
The enemy’s aggressiveness and determination to destroy them came as quite a shock. There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that they faced a much higher calibre of enemy than they had previously encountered in Zambia.  
Phil contacted base and called for immediate jet support Bob McKenna scrambled the Hunters from Thornhill air base, Gwelo, then immediately got airborne himself in a Lynx with pilot Trevor Jew at the controls.., and the two men made their way across the Zambezi to the target area as quickly as possible.  
They hoped to provide some support until the jets arrived, after which they would be able to give the Hunter pilots instructions on exactly where to make their strikes.  
Meanwhile, unbeknown to Phil Brooke and his men, a ZIPRA assault platoon was forming up behind them awaiting the word to advance.  
Subsequent intelligence revealed that ZIPRA were planning to draw the SAS nearer to them until just the right moment when they could sort them out properly.  
But the SAS ended up in dead ground and the enemy could not winkle them out... and ZIPRA had dispatched a platoon behind them with the task of annihilating every member of the callsign.  
Rich Stannard and his group were moving as fast as they could from the opposite direction to try and neutralise ZIPRA and take some of the weight of fire off Phil and his party, enabling them to get away. The vegetation was still bad and they were walking on a low ridge and not the high one as they had been instructed. Had they followed their original plan, they too would have got into a position where they were pinned down.  
There were a few old African kraals dotted here and there on their way and although they didn’t see any enemy, that familiar feeling of danger was there.  
At the very moment the ZIPRA assault platoon was readying themselves to advance on Phil’s callsign, the sound of a Rhodesian Lynx aircraft could be heard overhead.  
Bob McKenna and pilot Trevor Jew had arrived in the area slightly ahead of the jets, and as they approached the ridges, Bob spoke to Phil Brooke on the radio asking him for a sitrep.  
“’There are between 12 and 20 enemy shooting at us with mortars and recoilless rifles,” the patrol commander reported.  
As the Lynx got closer, the two men in the plane could see a recoilless rifle firing at Phil’s callsign and they agreed that if conditions were suitable, they would give the callsign a hand by dropping off their Frantan and firing rockets on the ridges.  
“Confirm the number of enemy?” Bob radioed Phil again.  
“Twenty maximum,” came the reply.  
“Okay. We’ll see what we can do,” the squadron commander said as the Lynx, with its deadly payload, got closer. “But if there are more than twenty, I’ll be bloody cheesed off.”  
During the air strikes the day before, the enemy had not fired a single shot and that said much for their fire discipline. This time, however, they had no intention of holding their fire.  
For the pinned-down SAS men, the Lynx had arrived in the nick of time. The ZIPRA holed up in the labyrinth of trenches, and those closing in on them, suddenly decided to turn their attentions away from the SAS men on the ground and concentrate on the plane and its two occupants.  
Bob told the pilot to turn in and put a strike on the recoilless rifle position and, as they turned for the dive, the sky was suddenly filled with bullets. The Lynx was met with a merciless hail of 12,7 millimetre and 14,5 millimetre anti-aircraft rounds and the trenches erupted with the muzzle flashes from a hundred enemy rifles.  
Phil Brooke and his men suddenly learned that there was an anti-aircraft position just fifty metres from them. The bush was so thick that they had not seen it. And by now, Rich Stannard and his team, racing to the rescue, were so close to the action that they were able to hear the terrorists cocking their weapons.  
“Bloody hell!” cursed the normally-calm “C” Squadron commander, as sheets of red tracer streamed past the cockpit.  
The pilot immediately aborted his strike without firing anything and turned away, the safety of his plane, his passenger and himself now of overriding importance.  
As he did so, an armour-piercing incendiary tracer from a 14,5 millimetre weapon smashed into the control panel between Bob and the pilot, then glanced off and came to rest in the front engine.  
The cockpit immediately filled with smoke and neither man could see the other.  
Shrapnel went into the pilot’s legs and other bits pinged into the plane. A flash of flame burned the hair on the SAS man’s legs and he silently cursed himself for not exchanging his shorts for the regulation pair of long trousers SAS men were supposed to wear on operations.  
But that was the very least of his worries at that precise moment. Both men knew that were their engine and fuel to catch alight or their bombs and rockets ignite, they could be blown to smithereens in an exploding ball of flame.  
Had the enemy held their fire for another five seconds, there is no doubt that the plane would have been shot from the sky.  
The two SAS callsigns on the ground could hear the pilot’s calls for help as he tussled with the stricken plane.  
“MAYDAY! MAYDAY!’” he yelled into his radio mouthpiece. “Get the hell out of here,” he instructed Bob McKenna.  
But Bob had no intention of baling out and leaving the pilot to his fate.  
“Negative, I’ll stay,” he replied adamantly.  
Back in Kariba, Sergeant Major _Petrol Paul_ who was running “C” Squadron’s tactical headquarters, could hear the drama being played out over his radio.  
“Hell! We’ve lost another squadron commander,” thought the sergeant major who had been with Martin Pearse when he was killed.  
Bob meanwhile was opening the window in the Lynx to get rid of the smoke, and, as the cockpit cleared, they discovered they were not on fire after all.  
But now they noticed the pilot had not fastened his parachute and while Trevor Jew did up his harness, Bob had to take over flying the plane.  
Fortunately, it was not a new experience for him as the SAS squadron commanders often practised flying with the pilots’ guidance, for just such emergencies as these.  
This time though, his knees were trembling so much with the shock and intensity of the attack, he had difficulty controlling the rudder.  
As the Lynx pulled away, Bob quickly called up Rich Stannard briefing him not to go up the ridge to Phil Brooke’s aid.  
“They’ve got mutually-supporting anti-aircraft positions and trenches,” he warned.  
“Move off and be prepared for pick-up.”  
Bob and the pilot were still unsure if the outside of the Lynx was on fire or not but were taking no chances and jettisoned their bombs and rockets.  
The two men finally settled down and realised that they would probably get back to Rhodesia in one piece, and as they flew back to base, they ran through their emergency procedures and did their normal checks. These revealed that the automatic controls affecting the hydraulics were not working.  
They tried to work the handcrank, the emergency facility that controlled the hydraulics, but hot hydraulic fluid sprayed all over the cockpit and they gave that up as a bad idea. It meant that the flaps would not be working when they needed them and the wheels would not go down.  
The pilot somehow managed to get the struggling aircraft back across the border, alerting Kariba military and civilian airstrip he was on his way and about to make an emergency landing  
On the way, the front engine packed in, and, left only with the back one, they limped over the lake.  
Crash crews and ambulances were already waiting for them as they came into Kariba airport Trevor Jew orbitted the airfield and asked Bob yet again if he wanted to parachute out. But the SAS commander decided to stay where he was.  
Then Trevor Jew made his approach run, switching off his remaining engine to glide in for a crash-landing. He had decided to head for the tarmac instead of the grass as he felt it would give him more control in the forthcoming skid.  
Bob held the passenger door open as the plane came down. They could not predict how the landing would go and had no intention of getting trapped in the cockpit.  
The fire crew hurtled down the airstrip after them as the crippled plane headed for the tar.  
It was a magnificent landing, The pilot put the Lynx gently down on its belly and as it skidded along the tarmac, sparks from the friction shot in every direction.  
The moment the plane stopped moving, there was a race to see who could get out of the plane first. The pilot tried to climb over Bob, but Bob being nearer the door and equally as motivated, swung his feet out and was on the tarmac first.  
Then the two men sprinted as far and as fast away from the Lynx as they could just in case a spark ignited the fuel. The crash crew was swift to react and when Bob and Trevor turned around again, it was to see the plane covered in foam to reduce the possibility of fire and an explosion.  
The Lynx was not badly damaged by the landing, and more harm was done hauling it off the tar than had been inflicted on crashing it.  
Miraculously, the two men had come through it all unscathed. “C” Squadron had not lost another commander and the air force still had the services of one of its brilliant young pilots. But they were badly shaken.  
Bob brushed himself down, swore, and immediately hurried to the radio room to report being shot down.  
“There are 200-odd guys out there shooting at us,” he briefed SAS HQ in Salisbury.  
“They are well dug in with recoilless rifles, mortars and heavy A/A weapons. Assess we need at least another 150 troops to attack the position. Alternatively, a nuke!”  
“We’ll send you another squadron,” came the reply from Salisbury.  
“You’d better send a lot more than that,” commented the squadron commander, not at all impressed.  
Meanwhile, the Rhodesian jets which had been flying high altitude during the battle with the Lynx had screamed into the pan and dropped their cargoes. It was indeed a comforting sight for the SAS boys still on the ground to see the familiar shapes of the Hunters once more.  
Several strikes were put in and occasionally the enemy could be seen changing fire position, each movement appeared to be a disciplined drill.  
Phil Brooke and his lads had very wisely conducted a swift tactical withdrawal: the position had hardly been abandoned as they had originally thought! Enemy 82 millimetre mortar bombs were dropping behind them.  
They pulled back ten kilometres (six miles) until they found a good landing zone for the chopper and were picked up and taken back to Kariba.  
Rich Stannard and his group had also withdrawn and were preparing for pick up.  
He silently earmarked an open spot for the helicopter landing zone, and as they moved towards it, saw three men sitting under a rocky outcrop.  
The SAS immediately carried out a flanking attack and when it was all over, two enemy lay dead and the third had a round through his femur.  
Remembering his earlier instructions, Rich decided to spare the man. It was to prove a wise decision.  
Initial interrogation revealed that the capture was none other than the camp logistics officer. Rich bandaged some of his flesh wounds, and medic Bruce Langley put up a drip. They called for an immediate casevac chopper and Rich lost no time signalling the good news to Bob McKenna.  
“Oh! and by the way,” he said, “I’ve got your capture for you!”  
Bob could hardly believe it. At least that part of the mission had gone according to plan.  
A chopper was dispatched across the lake and the capture was whisked back to Rhodesia to be delivered to an eagerly-awaiting SB officer.  
The prisoner revealed that the enemy were conventionally trained, and that there were some 200 men who were prepared to remain dug into their trenches and stand and fight, and not run away as was the normal enemy reaction.  
The captured man’s condition worsened during the night and he was flown to Kariba Hospital where his right leg was amputated. The next day, feeling much better, he spilled the beans to SB officer Pete Dewe, of the national intelligence team, who had been called from Salisbury to interview him.  
He said the enemy were from the First Battalion of ZIPRA’s First Brigade and they had moved into that particular piece of Zambian territory five weeks earlier from Mulungushi. It was to serve as their forward base until such time as the word came to cross the border in force into Rhodesia.  
They did not have a full complement of men yet and said that at the time of his capture there were 244 there. Another 100 reinforcements were expected.  
They had followed their orders to the letter during the initial air strikes and had held their fire hoping that the Rhodesians would think the place abandoned and not return.  
Nevertheless, they had been prepared for a confrontation and laid landmines on each of the two access roads. He was adamant that no amount of bombings or anything else would budge ZIPRA.  
The ZIPRA batallion commander had reminded his men that they were conventional soldiers and trained to hold their position. They were well fortified with an assortment of light and heavy weapons giving them more than a fighting chance in the event of attack.  
They had a good communications system with eleven two-way radios distributed throughout the camp. One radio linked the enemy to the regional commander based in nearby Lusoto, who in turn had direct contact with Lusaka.  
The camp, which was spread between the two ridges and the pan itself, was a conventionally prepared full-scale linear defensive position according to the Russian chapter.  
The place was obviously far bigger than the Rhodesians had first thought and it was clear they could not tolerate such a force sitting biding their time, waiting to pounce on Rhodesia. The initial plan of merely disrupting the enemy by ambushing was scrapped. Now an attack was to be mounted.  
Back at ComOps, Lieutenant-General Peter Walls ordered his RLI commandos to move to Kariba as quickly as possible to reinforce the SAS. As it so happened, a subunit of 2 Commando, RLI, under Major Pete Hean, had arrived at Kariba within a couple of hours of Bob’s crash landing to start border control operations. The rest of the RLI contingent was to come from 3 Commando and were flown to Kariba before first light. Men of “A” and “B” Squadrons of the SAS, who had been stood down for the weekend, were rounded up as they prepared to spend a rare Saturday night in the capital.  
The Hunters and Canberras, meanwhile, were being bombed up.  
The COs of the SAS and RLI had sat in on the interrogation of the wounded captive. The questions had now been answered and Operation _Tepid_ was about to begin.  
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
As there were more RLI troops than SAS and they formed the assault groups, overall command of the operation was to be by Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Bate of the RLI, with Lieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett of the SAS providing the alternative command function. Both were to use the airborne method of command from a Lynx aircraft.  
Major Pete Hean and Major Don Price were to command the RLI contingent. Pete and forty men from 2 Commando were to attack the eastern ridge, the biggest one where Phil Brooke had run into all his trouble and where it was assessed the greatest concentration of enemy were. Don Price, together with 32 men from 3 Commando would attack the western ridge.  
The SAS ground forces, tasked with sweeping through the camp after the ridges were taken, were to be commanded by Major Rob Johnstone.  
There were four RLI mortars in direct support of the two RLI groups; and a smaller SAS mortar team to support the SAS. All told, there were six 81 millimetre mortars, the most the Rhodesians could scrape up at such short notice.  
While the Rhodesians would not have the heavy artillery support as in other major externals, there would be two Hunters in direct support of the ground troops for the duration of the op.  
The troops were told that the enemy would stand and fight. However, the thinking was that as there was no longer any secrecy about the position, there was a very good chance ZIPRA may well have vacated the camp.  
A callsign headed by Phil Brooke, was taken back to the area on Saturday October 19 and placed on a hill to watch the camp and keep “C” Squadron commander up to date with comings and goings. Rain delayed the operation, but by the following day the weather had cleared and the mission was on.  
Trooping started early and five Bell 205s were to be used to ferry the security forces across the lake.  
Five waves delivered Pete Hean and the forty men of 2 Commando to the eastern ridge: and there were four waves needed to get Don Price and his 32 men from 3 Commando to the western side of the pan.  
Both groups were dropped about three kilometres to the north from the top of their respective ridges without attracting any opposition from the enemy.  
At 10h00, the Canberras would carry out a bombing run on the main ridge only ... followed two hours later by simultaneous ground attacks on both ridges.  
In ideal conditions, the attack ought to be mounted the moment air support lifted, but in this case, the bombing run had to be made over the heads of Pete Hean and his troops, and it was impossible for them to get from their landing position to their predetermined starting line at the top of the ridge in time to mount their attack.  
The planners felt that the air strike might serve to soften the target up a bit, so that, hopefully, by the time the assault went in, the ZIPRA men would have vacated their trenches.  
As it was, the air strike was ineffective and, as it did not appear to inflict a single casualty or serve to warn them off, the enemy just sat tight and waited.  
The two assault groups then began moving forward towards their respective ridges in readiness for the noon attack.  
At 11h00 the choppers flew in to drop off the RLI and SAS mortar teams three kilometres from the target.  
Ideally, mortars need to be out of sight, out of range and not affected by direct fire. Unfortunately, this time, their landing zones were on a forward slope and in full sight of the enemy positions and, as they touched down the familiar sound of enemy mortar crumps could be heard ranging in on the helicopters. The enemy had correctly assessed possible LZs and had previously zeroed in their mortars.  
As the Rhodesians ran to unload their bombs and set up their own mortars, they came under very effective and intensive enemy mortar bombardment and 75 millimetre recoilless rifle fire. There were also a fair amount of RPG-7 rockets directed towards them.  
It was accurate fire and quite worrying. It came as something of a shock, too, as they had been told they would be well out of range of enemy mortars. Later, they moved back slightly, but that did not work either and the enemy bombs continued to land among them.  
To be effective, the mortars needed to be mobile - to fire and move all the time. However, the mortar bombs were dropped off at the mortar base-plate position throughout the day and that was where they were to remain. To carry 400 ten-pound bombs around the bush was an impossibility.  
“A” and “B” Squadrons were dropped in shortly after the mortar teams had collected their share of the hot stuff and as each wave of troops arrived, so the enemy turned their collective attention to them.  
The SAS took up their positions on high ground domineering the enemy camp in readiness to sweep down through the bush of the central pan area once the RLI had taken their two ridges.  
“C” Squadron, who had already tangled with the camp residents, had dug their own trenches along the access road, to take on any Zambian Army contingent that decided to interfere.  
By noon, the 72 RLI assault troops were in position on the two ridges for the attack, having encountered no opposition during their advance.  
Pete Hean and his forty men were to have the advantage of being in a dominating position overlooking open terrain for their assault; but Don Price and his 32 troops would be assaulting uphill through the bush.  
Then the attack went in - and the moment Pete Hean and his men stuck their noses over the edge of the main ridge, two 14,5 millimetre heavy machineguns - one on each of the two ridges - opened up on them, putting down such extremely good and accurate fire that it had the forty men from 2 Commando thoroughly pinned down.  
The RLI were right on the crest of the ridge and in full view of the enemy. They could see right down into the enemy position. They could see the weapons positions ... the trenches … virtually the whites of the ZIPRA men’s eyes.  
The Rhodesians were in good cover and were behind large rocks and crevices and the enemy rounds were chipping away bits of the rock. Every so often when the firing died down, the RLI would get up and have a look and the enemy would start up again.  
When the 14,5 millimetre gunners took a breather, ZIPRA hidden from view in the gully, between the high point where the RLI were and the main ridge, kept up the attack. They started sending smallarms fire up the ridge then began lobbing up light mortar bombs at them.  
From the outset, it was very apparent that the Rhodesians were up against a vast assortment of military hardware- and an opposition whose discipline and determination were outstanding.  
There was a lull during which Don Price and his group of 32 men over on their hill carded on moving up their ridge. Suddenly, there was a roar from the heaviest smallarms fire the Rhodesians had heard for a long time - and Trooper Andy Houghton went down, fatally injured.  
Like the other group of RLl on the neighbouring ridge, Don Price and his men had been stopped dead in their tracks. They regrouped but were out of the battle. It was impossible to attack as they simply did not know where the enemy were among the vegetation.  
By now, Pete Hean had called for mortar support with the idea of putting down preparatory bombardment and covering fire on to the enemy position enabling his group to advance.  
But the RLI mortars were completely ineffective and of no help whatsoever to Major Hean and his men. The mortar commander was using the incorrect range tables ... and he was not searching for the enemy properly.  
Sergeant Major Pete Allan commanding the nearby SAS mortars volunteered his services and his mortars, but, as the SAS mortars were only there to protect the SAS in the event of their getting into trouble, his offer was not taken up. As a result the RLI mortars were unusable and the SAS mortar team - who had the correct range tables and a wealth of experience - sat around idle all day.  
When it became obvious the RLI mortars would be of no help, Pete Hean called in the Hunters to try and neutralise the two 14,5 millimetre positions and to stop the light mortar attacks. But the strikes were ineffective and the moment the RLI made the slightest move forward, so the enemy weapons started again.  
The day wore on and whenever the Hunters were overhead, Pete called for an airstrike, but they were unable to neutralise the enemy. The camouflage in the trenches was so good that the extremely vulnerable pilots could not positively identify the enemy gunners, and the strikes were off-target.  
Pete Hean realised he had to establish a secure starting point for his attack. His problem area was the little gully where the ZIPRA light mortars were positioned.  
He sent 16 men down from their high point into the gully, where, taking advantage of the small amount of cover, they cleared several trenches. But within half an hour, he had pulled them back - eight men had flesh wounds.  
Pete and his men now felt very vulnerable. They were on a high rocky ridge and didn’t even have entrenching tools to dig themselves into a reasonable position.  
Everything was on ZIPRA’s side. They had a very well-sited defensive position, were extremely well dug in and were well fortified with the heavy weapons positioned in such a way that if one was threatened, two others would provide covering fire.  
The numerically inferior attackers on the other hand were exposed and without the benefit of support weapons. Apart from the air strikes, which were ineffective, all the RLI had were rifles and hand-held 60 millimetre mortars, certainly no match for ZIPRA’s heavy weapons.  
It was obvious that with the enemy in trenches and the RLI in the open, there was no way they would be able to winkle them out without some other assistance. It was clear too, that, even with adequate covering fire, enabling the RLI to move in, the enemy had no intention of vacating their trenches during daylight hours when they were vulnerable to air strikes and whatever fire the ground troops planned for them.  
Pete Hean called for a casevac chopper for his eight men and asked that it bring in a 14,5 millimetre from Kariba. He felt it might just do the trick. As the RLI dominated the position, he hoped that, with their own 14,5, they would be able to put down effective fire on the ZIPRA 14,5 on the main ridge below.  
As a troop commander talked in Squadron Leader Ted Lunt, OC of the Bell Squadron, the commander mistook his chopper for another Bell and ended up talking the squadron leader straight in over the enemy position.  
ZIPRA stared in amazement as a lone helicopter flew low level just above their major support weapons positions.  
It was only when the squadron leader pulled away that the amazed ZIPRA decided to have a go at him ... and a trail of angry tracer followed him along the ridge.

Then, while the casevacs were being loaded on to the chopper, two pilots came in to try and eliminate the main 14,5 position for the final time that day.  
The sun was just starting to go down, and Pete Hean was talking to the first pilot trying to indicate the exact position of the heavy weapon. He dropped mortar smoke down on to the position, then gave the pilot a correction to bring him on to the right spot.  
“Hang on,” said the first pilot. “I’ll send my No. 2 in first; watch for the tracer coming up and follow him in. The No. 2 will strike where we think it is; I’ll see exactly where the trouble is and strike on it.”  
The No. 2 Hunter turned in - and before he was halfway down his dive, the 14,5s on both ridges opened up on it.  
The first pilot was hanging back 15 or so seconds behind and coming from a different angle.  
“Okay! I’ve got the bugger,” he said referring to the heavy weapon gunner on the main ridge.  
Pete Hean watched through his binoculars and saw him turn in for the attack. The enemy was firing as the pilot came down. Then he let his front 30 millimetre Aden cannons go.  
It was a pinpoint strike and the dust and stones flew everywhere as the weapon pit erupted and the weapon was momentarily silenced.  
The enemy gunner shook his head, grabbed hold of the 14,5 and swung it around again, firing up at the aircraft as it pulled away. The red tracer followed it up as the pilot flew off into the sunset, but none made its mark.  
Unfortunately for the Rhodesians, the ZIPRA gunner was so well protected, that short of getting it between the eyes, he was safe.  
It was clear they were not going to take the position that day, and the RLI men on both ridges pulled back for the night, leaving small patrols on top to give early warning.  
The enemy had undoubtedly won that round. It was the first time in Zambia that terrorists were determined to hold a position against an equally-determined attack. They were well-disciplined, knew how to use their weapons and were fairly happy about their defences.  
It seemed to SAS CO Garth Barrett, who took over the command at the end of the day, that the Rhodesians either had to accept they were there for a long time.., or they could expect them to pull out during the night.  
Earlier in the day, an SAS group from “C” Squadron had been placed on a possible escape route to the north-east, and from the air Garth Barrett selected the only other available enemy withdrawal route to the south-west, placing a twenty-man RLI ambush group on that track.

In the ZIPRA camp, the enemy’s resolve was not all it might have been.  
They had been subjected to relentless Rhodesian air strikes for hours. What was more worrying was they did not know if they would get a resupply of ammunition from Lusaka in time to hold the position. The battalion commander held regular meetings with his men during the night and eventually settled on a plan.  
Dead on the stroke of midnight, he gave the word and ZIPRA mounted a bombardment on the Rhodesian SAS position - and the war was on again.  
The dull thuds of enemy mortars could be heard in the distance ... and no one hoped more than the men in the SAS/RLI mortar lines that the bombs did not land anywhere near them. They were sitting and sleeping among piles of their own mortar bombs and equipment.  
Suddenly, there was an orange flash. Every Rhodesian eye followed it as it whistled through the night before smashing just short of their position and sending giant pieces of shrapnel among the SAS. It was a 122 millimetre rocket - a rocket the size of a man.  
There was a brief respite, then another orange flash sped across the pan. This time, the rocket hit a tree a few hundred metres from the main SAS position in the hills. But there was no danger to the men.  
Then the harassment started again. ZIPRA mortar fire was very accurate and an RLI chap in the mortar lines had the shrapnel in his sleeping bag to prove it.  
The bombardment, planned to cover ZIPRA’s withdrawal, had been worked out so that once the troops pulled out, the artillery teams would follow.  
ZIPRA’s morale was at an extremely low ebb. They were carrying their wounded and their heavy weapons and were more than a little nervous.  
The RLI ambush party positioned on the south-west escape route peered through the darkness as 150 enemy headed their way with much clanking and rattling of their heavy weapons.  
The young subby in command decided against taking on the terrorists. He felt they would have taken casualties against such superior odds. His party, he was to argue later, mainly comprised cooks and bottle-washers and as they had no heavy weapons or claymores to defend themselves, they were not keen to tackle 150 enemy of that calibre. Also, the enemy were spread out in little groups which made an ambush more difficult.  
It was “with astonishment” that everyone learned the enemy had made an orderly withdrawal during the night. There were some extremely harsh words said about the matter both then and later at the debrief.  
At first light, the SAS came from their high ground and swept down into the valley floor, while the RLI swept the two ridges. Unfortunately, because of ZIPRA’s withdrawal, the RLI never got the opportunity of using their own 14,5 against the enemy.  
Lieutenant Andrew Sanders felt that the SAS sweepline moving down into the pan was advancing too slowly and he made his way up front - straight into the tripwire strung across the thick bush. It set off two Pom-Z fragmentation anti-personnel mines either side of the wire spraying shrapnel in all directions.  
Both the lieutenant and Sergeant Steve Kluzniak, bore the brunt of the blast and were injured.., and the column came to a, grinding halt.  
The atmosphere was now quite tense. Cautiously, they eased forward, aware that there may be more tripwires waiting for them and possibly anti-personnel mines sown in the narrow tracks. There were two more wires strung across the thick undergrowth. They skirted around them, eventually reaching a main track that led into the start of the camp.  
The entire area was littered with piles of broken wood and dozens of ammunition boxes and gun chests. They could clearly see a turn-around point where vehicles had brought in the munitions.  
The security forces found endless kilometres of wire that linked the headquarters post in a corner of the pan to the positions all over the ridges. ZIPRA were so well organised that they had field telephones in every platoon headquarters.  
The Rhodesians were to take home the ZIPRA 14,5s, but the enemy had taken the precaution of removing the breach blocks. They were, therefore unusable.  
They found trenches with overhead cover, foxholes, and many positions contained steel helmets and gas masks.

To the north meanwhile, follow-up operations were continuing.  
Rich Stannard and his callsign were also joining in the search for the missing ZIPRA men. Suddenly, the eagle eyes of the lieutenant settled on a helmet sticking out from under a mound of grass and bushes. He yanked it out, then unearthed a veritable cache of helmets, packs and documents, which told of ZIPRA tactics and training and were to prove an invaluable insight into just how organised the conventional battalion had been.  
They were able to account for several enemy and were responsible for most of the kills on the follow-up operation. Apart from a few kills, the other groups failed to track down the rest of ZIPRA and the operation wound down a couple of days later.  
The mission had been bad news for the Rhodesians. They had grossly underestimated the enemy and had the living daylights shot out of them. They had been outgunned and outranged and had been unable to take the position.  
They had run into problems in Mozambique. Now, for the first time, they were in serious trouble in Zambia.  
There were said to be nine other defensive positions along the Zambian border, but the Op _Tepid_ camp was the only one attacked. They eventually found the others, but by then it was too late. The war was over.
