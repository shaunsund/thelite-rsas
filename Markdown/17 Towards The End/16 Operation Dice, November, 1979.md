The Special Air Service together with their Air Force friends were now planning to deliver a decisive blow to ZANLA and their host country. It would not only make ZANLA suffer, but it was also designed to bring Mozambique to her knees.
Their mission - codenamed _Manacle_ - would be presented as a _fait accompli_ to Samora Machel who would be forced into a comer. The military planners hoped that by crippling his country, he would, in exchange for economic survival, abandon ZANLA and kick Mugabe and his men out for good. Alternatively, they wanted him to force Mugabe to stay talking at the Lancaster House conference.
In a series of slick moves, the SAS and Air Force were to sweep down Mozambique flattening key road, rail and river bridges of economic, strategic and tactical importance, bridges that were not only crucial to ZANLA’s infiltration routes into Rhodesia, but vital to Mozambique’s economy.
The Tete Bridge had been on the hit list, but at the eleventh hour, just as SAS commander Major Dave Dodson and his team of saboteurs were about to set sail down fiver with their load of explosives, the mission was called off. It had suddenly been learned that the Tete Bridge was just too important to drop. The International Monetary Fund had financed its building and it was felt that if the Rhodesians destroyed it, they would not be looked upon favourably should international recognition follow the all-party elections everyone in London was talking about.
Planning continued for the destruction of the other bridges, however, and was at an advanced stage. The demolition charges had been made and all the detailed tasks had been drawn up. The troops had been recalled to Salisbury and were poised for the op.
Then, suddenly, the ComOps planners changed the priority. The main threat was not so much Mugabe’s ZANLA who could be contained for now, but Nkomo’s ZIPRA Joshua Nkomo had suddenly woken up to the fact that if the Lancaster House talks were to produce a ceasefire, eighty percent of his troops were outside the country, whereas eighty percent of Mugabe’s were _inside_.
Nkomo had never been interested in pushing in droves of men just for the sake of it He was more interested in building up and training his conventional army. Then, when the time was right, he would fully arm his battalions, consolidate his conventional forces into a highly trained army and invade Rhodesia with Russian and Cuban backing,
But the SAS’s highly successful Operation _Chicory_ on Nkomo’s massive arms cache near Lusaka had hit him hard and seriously delayed his plans. He had lost those arms and had been unable to replace them.
The repeated bombings at Mulungushi conventional training camp, while they did not kill vast numbers, had also disrupted his plans.
Before Nkomo could mobilise his battalions, arm them and put his invasion plans into effect, Lancaster House happened and he realised he had seriously miscalculated. Now, itwas imperative he get as many of his troops into Rhodesia before a ceasefire to vote, and influence the elections by getting others to vote.
Should the elections not go the way he wanted, he would still have the bulk of his men in Rhodesia to continue the war. He also had to get his men out of Zambia in the event of a ceasefire and Kaunda changing his stance and agreeing to disarm his ZIPRA friends.
Three thousand ZIPRA had already crossed the border in a last-ditch bid to have as many men as possible pop up out of the bush when a ceasefire was announced and to prepare the way for the conventional forces.
Intelligence now revealed that despite previous setbacks, Nkomo’s conventional army was finally going to do their bounced river crossing over the Zambezi in the push to take Rhodesia by force, by sending in motorised infantry battalions under the umbrella of Russian-supplied MiG fighters.
ZIPRA planned on taking over the main airfields, and the invasion force of conventional and guerilla forces hoped to have taken Salisbury within 24 hours of infiltrating.
As if to confirm this, the Rhodesians had picked up a sudden increase in aircraft movement into Angola and Zambia, which subsequent intelligence proved were airlifts of armoured personnel carriers and artillery.
There were two essential prerequisites for the ZIPRA military potential to be realised. First, they had to establish a bridgehead on the Rhodesian bank of the Zambezi; second, they needed the air support for it to be maintained.
The major fronts where the bounced river crossing was going to take place were at Victoria Falls and Kariba, and there was a vague possibility of ZIPRA using the area east of Chirundu.
Nkomo’s plans for a large-scale conventional infiltration was the biggest threat Rhodesia had faced, and the Rhodesian planners ruled, that, as a matter of great urgency, Operation Manacle be put in cold storage until the ZIPRA plan was blunted.
ComOps knew there were between 18 000 and 25 000 ZIPRA amassing in Zambia, most of them trained in conventional warfare. Nkomo had been training his conventional infantry motorised battalions at Mulungushi camp to the north of Kabwe and was ferrying troops down to an assembly point known as CGT-2 some fifty kilometres (31 miles) to the north-east of Lusaka on the Great North Road.
Conventional terrorists under training in Angola and possibly others in Ethiopia were also going to make their way to CGT-2, plus every other guerilla in Zambia.
It was this large concentration of enemy in one camp who were capable of launching a conventional attack on Rhodesia which was causing such concern at ComOps.
At the same time, by marshalling his forces at one camp for the first time in ZIPRA’s history, it meant that if the camp was attacked, they could disrupt ZIPRA’s war machine and destroy it once and for all.
According to intelligence, there were more than 4 000 ZIPRA at CGT-2 at any one time. ZIPRA were moving their men from CGT-2 down to a series of prepared forward deployment bases, each manned by conventional troops, along the length of the Rhodesian border overlooking the Zambezi River and Lake Kariba.
Their function was to monitor the river and when their particular crossing point was secure, they would signal ZIPRA headquarters in Lusaka; then Lusaka would send a message to CGT-2 and men would be bundled into trucks and ferried to whichever forward base could form a bridgehead from where they could infiltrate into Rhodesia.
Then, groups of 100-plus would enter Rhodesia, some of them caching their weapons and equipment and walking into the villages to create a presence for the voting and prepare the way for the conventional forces.
When ComOps learned of this build-up at CGT-2 and the movement down to the border, it was decided that security forces had to get into Zambia without delay to smash ZIPRA and limit their ability to mount a conventional attack. They were to bomb CGT-2 off the face of the earth with every available aircraft; and hit all other known terrorist positions.
It was critical too, that ZIPRA’s access and supply routes be cut immediately.
The Special Air Service, and in some instances the RLI and Selous Scouts, had to infiltrate deep into Zambia and sit across ZIPRA routes, ambush their vehicles and stop the large deployments southwards. If the routes were made inaccessible to vehicles and ZIPRA had to walk and carry their equipment, then it was felt they would probably not bother.
Other units would have to go back to the old border control duties to hit ZIPRA as they crossed the border.
Operation _Dice_ the last major external operation of the war, was about to begin.
The whole SAS Regiment which had been regrouped in Salisbury and which was busy preparing for Op _Manacle_ was sent to Kariba from where it would stage its attacks against ZIPRA.
However, while ComOps was determined to halt the hordes of ZIPRA about to come thundering across the border, they initially imposed strict limitations on the SAS’s _modus operandi_.
It was obvious both to the military planners and the SAS that the only way to stem the terrorist tide was to destroy the Zambian communications network by cutting the road and rail bridges, thereby preventing them using their heavy vehicles and forcing them to eithcr walk or to go by a circuituous, time-consuming route.
It was not a new thought and the planners had raised the issue on numerous occasions over the years. But permission had always been denied for political reasons.
There were sound economic reasons- Rhodesia exported and imported on those very routes - and it was not government policy to attack strategic targets in Zambia.
At the start of Op _Dice_ that necessary permission was still not forthcoming from the politicians and the SAS’s task was solely to monitor and ambush the road, which the planners and the SAS all knew was a total waste of time.
It did not take much to realise that ambushing was a very limited project and would probably account for a few hundred enemy only. Then, having hit one convoy, the Zambian Army would be alerted, the news passed back to ZIPRA in Lusaka and on to CGT-2 - and the terrorists would be stopped using that particular route. Roads would be guarded, the element of surprise lost, and the security forces would not achieve their aim.
It was a situation that worded the CO, the squadron commanders and the planners, and while they attempted to convince the politicos to take on ZIPRA more aggressively by blowing the bridges, “A” and “B’” Squadrons were deployed across the border to make the roads untenable for ZIPRA, while “C” Squadron was held in reserve for anything untoward that may happen.
The CO, meanwhile, took the precaution of moving all the explosives intended for Operation _Manacle_ to Kariba in the event of the go-ahead being given.
Lieutenant Pete Cole worked through the night preparing demolition kits and carrying out procedures normally done on site. By morning, he had the first three demolition kits ready. Now all they needed was the green light.
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
Lieutenant Mike Rich and his team of 15 operators from “B” Squadron were on their way to ambush a road south-east of Lusaka on the Kafue-Chirundu road, and early on November 13 they were choppered their regulation distance away from the road.
Six hours later they had found a suitable spot on the side of a hill where they could base up for the rest of the day before beginning their work. They checked out the area and after leaving one man on guard, the others settled down in their usual circle formation.
There was very little cover…just thin vegetation and a few trees, 16 SAS men kitted up in _Black-ls-Beautiful_ with their regalia of war sprawled around it. Soon, all but the guard were sleeping soundly.
Then the sentry began to hear shuffling and scuffling. Gradually, the scuffling developed into a series of muffled shouts and screams as eight men on one side of the circle streaked out of their sleeping bags - and stranger yet, began tearing their clothes off!
Soon, everyone on the other half of the circle was awake. Each man had gabbed his rifle and was gazing nervously into the distance, trying to work out what all the pandemonium was about.
Then, the eight stark-naked men streaked up the hill.
Eventually, the commander and his fully-dressed men managed to herd the naked ones together to establish that a massive army of red nipping ants had infested the area they had chosen to sleep in, leaving a legacy of huge red welts on their victims.
Red soldier ants were some of the meanest little creatures in the bush and, as any operator will tell you, something worth tearing one’s trousers off for.
There was then the ridiculous situation of 16 fully-grown very tough SAS soldiers, half of them naked, cowering part way up the hill gazing down at the mound of discarded clothes, weapons and kit, and nobody brave enough to go down and rescue them.
While ZIPRA and ZANLA did not worry SAS men, an army of aggressive ants was a different matter entirely.
Eventually, the eight naked chaps regained their composure and were assured their clothes were free from ants. Everyone gathered up his kit and away they all went, getting a slightly earlier start than they had planned.
It was the beginning of what was to turn out to be an incident-filled week. Thereafter, it would be the Zambians and ZIPRA who would feel the pinch.
Mike Rich had hoped to spring his ambush in some of the ravines and rivers which went across the tar road shown on his map, but they could not be located in the area he wanted to use. It meant he had to rely on springing his ambush by using a bank of claymores, which would be set off by his demolition expert. There would also be two RPG-7 rocket launchers and the normal good smattering of RPDs right throughout the 12-man ambush party, while in the observation position high above the road was Sergeant _Small Bez_ and his team manning the 60 millimetre mortar.
At last light on November 15, they were in their position along the side of the road, and at 20h15 _Small Bez_ up on his hill, came on the radio to report seeing lights.
As the vehicle came up the hill, the demolition man pressed the button to set off the claymores and rip the vehicle to shreds. Everyone else kept his head down to avoid the expected blast. But nothing happened.
Lieutenant Mike Rich banged the demolition man on the shoulder to indicate that he should fire once more and the claymore operator quickly went through a series of tests on the exploder. Realising that something was wrong, the commander initiated the contact himself by firing at the vehicle.
By now the two handpicked RPG-7 operators up the road had also realised that the claymores were not going to work and both fired rockets at the target.
Unbelievable as it seemed, one rocket went straight under the Land-Rover- while the other went sailing straight over it. Thus, the double knock-out blow had failed, as had the magical claymores.
As most of the callsign had been keeping their heads down to protect themselves from the claymore blast, only a few rounds were fired.
For the occupants of the Land-Rover, their luck was in that night and they were able to make good their escape. But they must have been startled to see a couple of RPG-7 rockets flying at them through the night.
The ambushers learnt later that the Land-Rover contained a couple of Zambian Army officers and one had been slightly wounded. The SAS had been briefed not to take on Zambian Army personnel, so perhaps it was fortunate that things had gone wrong,. But there were red faces all around at the time.
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
Meanwhile, back in Rhodesia, the go-ahead had been given to drop the bridges.
It was a bold decision and would have a dramatic effect on Zambia. By destroying the bridges, Rhodesia hoped not only to stop the ZIPRA hordes, but also to put enough pressure on Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda to convince Nkomo to stay talking at the Lancaster House conference - and to make sure he helped the London talks towards a successful conclusion.
In view of previous SAS activity, Zambia was particularly vulnerable to such pressure at that time.
By the severing of the Tazara rail link a few weeks earlier, Kaunda had effectively been robbed of his export and import route to the north and beyond. The line had not yet been repaired although the Zambians were still sending goods in both directions up to the Chambeshi bridge, unloading them on to trucks and taking them in a roundabout route to the other side.
That only left him the southern route to South Africa over which the vast majority of all Zambian imports and exports travelled - and that ran through Rhodesia over the Victoria Falls bridge.
Thus Kaunda’s sole economic lifeline ran through Rhodesia - and Kaunda needed that route to feed his people.
Rhodesia, however, had no immediate plans to cut Zambia’s rail line with the south. They were very aware that to do so would have a direct effect on the entire Zambian economy. The idea was not so much to cripple Zambia but to show her that her southern neighbour meant business.
By dumping the other Zambian bridges to stop ZIPRA’s movement southwards, the Rhodesians would prove that they could, if they chose to, also sever the rail line south of Lusaka. They were hoping to get their point across before resorting to such a drastic measure. Routes that were not cut were to be heavily landmined.
While the Zambians were loath to take on the security forces in strength, intelligence indicated that the Zambians would not hesitate to engage small groups or enemy aircraft
The Zambians had become very concerned by the apparent ease with which Rhodesians were able to locate and strike at ZIPRA targets in Zambia. The SAS’s sabotage of the Chambeshi bridges had made them aware the Rhodesians planned to go in for more strategic targets and additional guards had been placed on major bridges and trunk routes to prevent a repetition of the Chambeshi incident “B” Squadron’s unsuccessful ambush on the Zambian Army Land-Rover had taken place near three bridges and now that the Zambian Army knew there was a Rhodesian presence in the area, there was every likelihood they would dispatch guards to protect those bridses.
It was imperative the Rhodesians destroy the bridges before the Zambians had time to react
Their destruction would hamper ZIPRA movement southwards and to Chirundu as well as isolate Chirundu, where there was a border bridge. Nkomo would thus be unable to move his heavy troop-carrying vehicles down to the border and across the bridge.., or even down to the border where his men could debuss and walk across. It also meant that the access road to Kariba Dam wall dividing Zambia from Rhodesia would be cut
Lieutenant Mike Rich and his ambushers were instructed to get moving down the road and use their left-over mines and explosives to blow a culvert and make the road unusable. After that, they were to head towards the northerly bridge, to await the rest of  “B” Squadron.
Leaving _Small Bez_ and his 60 millimetre mortar team behind in the hills to give early-warning of the Zambian Army, they blew the culvert and cracked the road, but the damage was not sufficient to stop ZIPRA or anyone else using iL Then they doubled along the road for a couple of hours until they reached their bridge… and early next morning, November 16, Operation _Dice_ got under way in earnest.
It was now an open Rhodesian raid and the SAS men kitting-up in Kariba to link up with the blackened-up ambushers wore Rhodesian camouflage and no _Black-Is-Beautiful_.
Four Bell 205s flew out from Kariba in close formation taking the “B” Squadron operators, a heavy cargo of explosives and two 20 millimetre cannons and crews to the road snaking through the Zambian mountain pass.
The plan was to secure the area quickly, blow the bridges and be away before the Zambians knew what had hit them. The two 20 millimetre cannon crews - one commanded by Sergeant Major Johnny Masson and the other under Colour Sergeant Nick Breytenbach - were to provide protection in the hills on either side of the three bridges.
Johnny Masson and his team linked up with _Small Bez_ on the Chirundu side of the road - the side where the Zambian Army were most likely to react - and, after dropping off a load of explosives to Lieutenant Mike Rich at his bridge on the Kafue side of the road, the choppers put Nick Breytenbach and crew and their 20 millimetre down further along the road to stop any interference from that access.
Another chopper peeled off to put Squadron Commander Colin Willis and his team down close to the centre bridge… while the last chopper continued to bridge number three to drop Pete Cole and his crew.
As Colin and his men came in to land at their centre bridge, a white Land-Rover went screaming past beneath them. The worried passengers stared at the chopper and heavily armed white soldiers with the biggest eyeballs the SAS had seen. But Colin decided to spare them. He felt the priority was to get on with the task - and he let the Land-Rover and its passengers continue unharmed.
But as the Land-Rover roared on its way through the mountain pass to get clear of the Rhodesian choppers, Lieutenant Pete Cole and his team still en route to their bridge, began to take a keen interest in the speeding vehicle.
Time was short, but the passengers appeared to be dressed like ZIPRA and it was too good an opportunity to miss.
Getting the pilot to put down in a field instead of on the bridge as planned, Pete Cole tasked one man with a machinegun and another with an FN to prepare to engage the vehicle. As the chopper came in to land, the two soldiers leapt out and hurried forward to take up their ambush positions.
The others quickly yanked the explosives out of the chopper and as it lifted and set course for Rhodesia, the two ambushers opened up on the Land-Rover. Then the entire callsign joined in and took on the vehicle and its passengers.
Although injured, the driver managed with superhuman effort to stumble out of the door and run down the road. A hail of angry bullets pursued him.
Within a couple of minutes, it was all over. The driver lay dead on the side of the road, and the lifeless body of the passenger lay peppered with rounds and slumped in the bullet-fiddled Land-Rover.
The SAS didn’t think that anyone had survived, but subsequent intelligence revealed that two ZIPRA had the good sense to flee as the vehicle sped along the pass into the ambush… and one had been wounded as he headed for the sanctuary of the nearby Zambian Army post.
The injured terrorist turned out to be none other than the ZIPRA battalion commander of the Operation _Tepid_ position who had been making his way back to the camp site to see if it could be used again. It was his second encounter with the SAS and he knew he was lucky to have survived.
Hidden behind the seats of the Land-Rover was an assortment of weapons, maps and documents listing names of terrorists en route to Rhodesia, and a crossing point previously unknown to the Rhodesians.
Meanwhile, the Zambian Army with their usual lack of haste, were on their way to the scene of the previous day’s ambush. They came in three armoured vehicles and five trucks and were not the most welcome visitors to have stumbling into a demolition task.
￼![400 - Dice](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/400%20-%20Dice.png)
Colin Willis gave the SAS men manning the 20 millimetre cannon and 60 millimetre mortar in the mountains the go ahead to open up on them and they proceeded to keep the Zambians at bay from their hillside perch… while further along the mountain pass the three demolition teams got on with the business of destroying the bridges.
The demolition commanders quickly made an appreciation of their targets and the explosives and initiation sets were moved into a safe place under the bridges.
Then the six-man demolition crews quickly and efficiently went through their various drills, which they had down to an incredibly fine art, enabling them to smash the bridges in record time.
While all this feverish activity was taking place, a white Peugeot pick-up came roaring along the road and was about to drive into the blast. The driver was flagged down and his truck commandeered.
The demolition commanders lit the safety fuses and took cover. One after the other, the three bridges were demolished as ZIPRA and their host nation were dealt their first body blow.
The damage was assessed, photographs were taken, kit packed up and the abandoned ZIPRA Land-Rover set ablaze.
Colin Willis and Pete Cole and their teams headed south towards the foothills to get out of the reach of an immediate reaction force and find a suitable LZ for their helicopter recovery… while Lieutenant Mike Rich and his callsign were tasked to mine the access road on his side of the mountain pass.
All their equipment was loaded on to the commandeered truck and it was used to ferry a team down to an old detour road under construction, which the Zambians might well decide to rebuild now that the three bridges had been dumped. It was just the place to plant a couple of landmines in case they did.
On the way, they cut the telephone lines to isolate the area even further and a couple of well-placed RPG-7 rockets destroyed a building which looked like an electricity sub-station. Closer inspection revealed it to contain only a few telephone wires, but in any event, it was not much use to anyone after they had finished with it.
They picked up the 20 millimetre cannon and crew on their side of the mountain pass using the vehicle, and they all returned to the blown bridge to await uplift, listening to the SAS men still on the mountains fighting a duel with the Zambian Army.
After the panic and urgency to get to the bridges, and the excitement of getting them down in just twenty minutes, they now faced a long idle wait for the choppers to collect them. When they finally arrived, there were only three: the fourth had run into difficulties back in Rhodesia, and the teams in the mountains would have to stay where they were and continue engaging the Zambian Army for a few more hours.
It had been an eventful day. But there was still one more incident to come.
As one of the choppers touched down at Kariba, its mission complete and its passengers safely delivered to Rhodesian shores, a cable connecting the tail rotor blade suddenly severed.., and as the SAS stepped on to the tarmac, the pilot casually informed them that had they been airborne for another ninety seconds, they would have crashed.
Back in the Zambian mountains, the SAS had won their clash with the Zambians, forcing them to abandon their armoured vehicles. By the time reinforcements had arrived, the SAS’s 20 millimetre cannon had destroyed two of the three armoured vehicles and they were blazing away merrily.
The SAS cannon crew then opened up on the reinforcements in their trucks and on their commander in the Land-Rover at the front of the column. The startled Zambian troops sat nonplussed on the back of their open trucks and wondered where the trouble was coming from.
Then the enemy commander leapt from his Land-Rover, ran to the back of the truck, and belted his men with a huge stick. That finally provoked some reaction and they all scurried for cover.
Nine hours after being dropped off, the choppers came in to pluck the SAS men from their hill. They loaded up their cannon, threw in their kit and set course for Kariba. There were other tasks to do and preparations had to be made.
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
A couple of days later, “B’” Squadron gathered for another briefing.
This time, Colin Willis told them the mission was to destroy a bridge on the Great North Road, seventy kilometres (43 miles) south of Lusaka.
At 07h00 they flew off over the lake to Zambia, over the endless trees and the scatterings of African huts, until about 07h20, they saw the Great North Road snaking before them in the distance.
Having dropped off the first five-man protection party, the choppers continued on to put down the demolition team and a second protection party. But as they circled the bridge, thirty Zambian Army soldiers guarding the target opened up on the Rhodesians with smallarms fire. The SAS machinegunner returned fire from the second chopper.
As the choppers continued circling the bridge and the gunners gave the Zambians the occasional burst, Colin silently debated what they should do for the best.
He knew that if they went down, they would not only take casualties, but as they would have to take on the Zambian Army, it could well spark off an international incident. On the other hand, if they _didn’t_ go down, the bridge would stay intact and ZIPRA would continue to travel southwards across it.
Eventually, the pilot made up his mind. They would have to abort the mission and go home, he decided. “No,” Colin Willis pointed out. They couldn’t afford to do that. They had to stop the road being used.
Quickly, Colin studied his map. There was a bridge twenty kilometres (12 miles) further north over the Kaleya River. Couldn’t they just pop up there and see what the story was, he suggested?
The pilot agreed… and the two men were delighted to find much better pickings altogether. It was a much bigger bridge and, as a bonus, was unguarded.
The protection group put down earlier, was collected… and before long, the demolition team and their mound of explosives were deposited next to Kaleya road bridge.
Within moments, they had slipped on their skin-tight rubber gloves necessary to prepare the _Wonder Glue_ to attach the charges to the bridge. Another surgical operation was about to be performed to cut ZIPRA’s access routes to the south.
A rail gang working on repairs 300 metres south of the road bridge stood and watched in wide-eyed amazement as the demolition team scurried back and forth under the bridge.
Someone waved the muzzle of a rifle at them, but it made not the slightest difference and they made no attempt to move away.
A Zambian police patrol put in an appearance and fired ten rounds of automatic fire at the saboteurs. The SAS protection party returned fire - and the Zambians sped off again.
By now, all the activity at the bridge had attracted a crowd of onlookers, who, unperturbed by the exchanges between the Rhodesians and Zambians, seemed equally fascinated at the strange goings-on that morning.
They, too, appeared a friendly lot and even though warning shots were fired above them, they were reluctant to move away.
Once the charges were laid, Pete Cole lit the fuses and raced across the bridge to join the rest ofthe SAS in the back of the railway gang’s truck. Then they drove off to a safe spot while the bridge blew.
￼![403 - Hagar](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/403%20-%20Hagar.png)
With some ten million US dollars worth of communications damage caused by the SAS.
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia might well wonder when the Rhodesians would strike again. Within twenty minutes of arriving, there was a deafening roar, the earth shook and the Kaleya bridge was downed. Three spans and two piers crashed into the riverbed, raising a cloud of smoke and dust high into the sky.
As they reversed their borrowed truck to inspect the damage, they noticed that the crowd of onlookers had swelled considerably.
It was time for the 16 men to head home again. But the choppers had returned to Rhodesia to refuel and as the turn-around time was ninety minutes, the SAS were ready to pull out even before the choppers had arrived back in Kariba.
There was only one option left. They would just have to hijack the rail gang’s truck to make their escape. The railway workers were in no position to protest and with a wave to the rail crew and the mesmerised locals, the smiling SAS men were soon on their way trucking southwards, stopping on the way while one man leapt out to cut the telephone wires.
Sixty kilometres (37 miles) from Kaleya bridge, they abandoned the truck dumping it in a small dam where it could be recovered without much effort.
They radioed for pick-up and the Bells were soon with them.., and in no time at all they were off home again, exhilarated by their success although very tired, especially those who had been up most of the night preparing the charges.
There was just one moment of crisis that day. As one chopper came in to land at the airstrip a terrific crunching vibrated through the plane as the beatings on the rotor blade broke up. Had they been airborne, the chopper would have spiralled into the ground and they would all have been killed.
It was the second lucky escape for some SAS men that week and they quickly debussed, hardly dating to believe their good fortune.
Four-and-a-half hours after leaving Kariba the bridge-blowers were back in Rhodesia, the day’s action over and another bridge rendered useless to frustrate ZIPRA’s push southwards and further enrage Kenneth Kaunda.
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
Meanwhile Captain Bob McKenna and Lieutenant Phil Brooke of “C” Squadron had returned to New Sarum, boarded a light aircraft and after a circuitous journey, entered Zambian airspace.
They were looking for a suitable road and rail target north of Lusaka for the next phase of the bridge demolition programme.
While the SAS had been forbidden to drop rail bridges south of Lusaka, the northern rail line - the Tazara link - was considered expendable. By dropping the Chambeshi the month before, the Rhodesians had already declared an open policy on the line. Besides, dropping another portion would make the Zambians’ shuttle service even more complicated to organise.
The two SAS men flew low along the rail line studying it with their binoculars.
There was a parallel road three kilometres from the line and where there was a rail bridge there was a corresponding road bridge over the river.
They noticed that most of the rail bridges had a small tented camp near one end belonging to the railway police and militia who guarded the bridge.
They were looking for a spot where the choppers would be able to land virtually on the bridge, or very close by; a bridge where the piers were accessible and not submerged in water, and a target where the nearby military presence was relatively small so that they could deal with it. Ideally, they needed a road and rail bridge that were close enough to be demolished virtually at the same time; and where the Rhodesian troops could support each other.
It was a tall order, but they eventually managed to find a pair of bridges 150 kilometres (93 miles) east of Lusaka, which, except for a small police camp, fitted their requirements.
Back in Kariba, the commander was forced to make a quick change of plan when he learned that one of the choppers had become unserviceable. It was a setback, but the job could still go ahead. It meant they would have eight men less and would not be able to take such a vast quantity of explosives.
The three Bells with a total of twenty SAS operators on board plus two Lynx aircraft took off from Kariba and were soon overflying Zambia and waving at the civilians below, who now, used to such frequent comings and goings, usually waved back.
Within an hour, they were at the target. The choppers peeled off to their respective bridges; the passengers and their explosives were offloaded and the Bells pulled away, putting down in the bush twenty kilometres (12 miles) away, but keeping their turbines running in readiness for the call to recover the troops.
As the SAS approached the rail bridge with their load of explosives, they came under automatic smallarms fire from Zambian police hidden in the bush. The operators were far too busy to take on properly the troublesome police. So Bob McKenna gave the necessary target indications to the Lynx pilots orbitting the bridges and they swooped in low to deal with the enemy.
One of the piers of the rail bridge was on the far side of the river bank and it meant that operators had to walk over the exposed rail line carrying the charges on their shoulders, then humping them down the steep bank where they could be set up.
Sergeant Major Bruce Langley coolly led the way across the exposed bridge, a box of explosives on his shoulders and a complete disregard for the potential danger he was in from the enemy fire… and his gallantry that day was largely responsible for the Bronze Cross of Rhodesia he was subsequently awarded.
The planes had soon sorted out the Zambians, either by silencing them permanently or scaring them away.
Over at the road bridge, things were going well. In keeping with the policy of not killing civilians, they were stopping all traffic to prevent it being on the bridge when it was blown, and by the time the bridge was wired up, there were forty cars lined up on either side with the drivers and passengers being treated to a grandstand view of the whole operation.
The road bridge was the first to go and the demolition completely wrecked several of the piers and spans, spraying chunks of concrete and dust everywhere and leaving the frustrated motorists no alternative but to turn around and storm back the way they had come.
The rail bridge was not completely demolished due to the thickness and the extremely heavy reinforcing of the piers and because they had been unable to take sufficient explosives. However, traffic was unable to travel over it and the Zambians had to knock the remains of the bridge down in order for it to be rebuilt From start to finish, the demolition had taken just three hours, and they were so fast that Bob McKenna and his Sergeant Major were able to join “B” Squadron that afternoon to help blow another major road bridge, the essence being to get as many bridges down as soon as possible before the guard could be strengthened.
Bridge number seven was about to be dumped.

The SAS’s new target was the Chongwe River bridge, a mere 35 kilometres (21 miles) from Lusaka, the first major bridge ZIPRA would have to cross after leaving CGT-2 assembly area on their way southwards.
An aerial photographic reconnaissance showed that there was a Zambian Army national service defence force training camp a few metres from the bridge and that the target was also guarded by a platoon of soldiers.
This particular bridge was not going to be so easy and they were apprehensive about what would happen. Not only did they have to worry about the bridge defenders but, as the bridge was so close to Lusaka, there was a very real possibility of air force jets being scrambled.
Timings would be critical and a decision was made to call in the heavies of the Rhodesian Air Force to support them in case of Zambian Air Force interference; or to destroy the bridge if it were so heavily guarded that the ground troops could not land.
The thirty-man assault team was split into a six-man demolition squad - four men to lay the charges and two to cover their movements and provide protection.
There would be one road block team on the side of the road near the Zambian Army camp… and another, including a 20 millimetre cannon crew, were to be on the opposite side of the river.
There was no sign of the Zambian Army when the bulk of the SAS troops were put down, but. as the fifth and last chopper bearing the demolition team flew in, they saw six Zambians near an army ambulance and opened fire on them.
The chopper landed, the SAS yanked their explosives from the Bell and hurried to the bridge, keeping their heads well down. The chopper lifted immediately, then was gone.
Now and then the Zambian bridge defenders clashed with the SAS, but most were far more interested in getting away.
Nick Breytenbach quickly got the cannon sorted out and began firing the high explosive rounds into the army camp to keep the Zambians out of the fracas.
Rounds cracked over the heads of the demolition team as they went through their time-tested drills, while yet others thumped into the riverbank.
Meanwhile, inside the Zambian Army base the bugler was hitting the panic button ... and blasting away at full volume in Seventh Cavalry fashion to warn of the dangers without
But as soon as the first couple of SAS cannon shells exploded in the camp, his urgent signals trailed off dramatically.., and all that could be heard after that was the continuous wailing of sirens.
And at no stage during the proceedings did anyone venture out of the camp to aid their bridge-defender colleagues.
The original plan had been for the stop group nearest the Army base to straddle the road to halt traffic driving into the demolition. But it was impossible to do that as they were being fired at by those Zambians still trying to defend the bridge and most of the SAS were taking cover in a trench running parallel with the road.
At about the same time two strapping SAS men were running along the road to check that a Zambian soldier they had shot was down for good, a huge Mercedes car came screeching along the road.
At the sight of the two aggressive weapon-brandishing white soldiers charging towards them, the petrified driver took the only possible course available.
He did an immediate left-turn and careered through the bush heading straight for an African village, which, because of all the activity at the bridge, had been hurriedly vacated leaving only chickens, pigs and dogs in residence.
The Mercedes came to a rest against a sturdy pole with a sickening crunch - but not before all four doors were flung open and the nattily-dressed pin-striped occupants shot off into the bush in all directions Keystone Cop fashion, and hard on the heels of all the squawking, flapping farmyard creatures.
Five minutes before detonation time, a Toyota Landcruiser doing about 130 kilometres (80 miles)-an-hour came screeching past the SAS lying in the trenches on the side of the road.
Warning shots failed to stop the driver, and having broken through their roadblock he continued on his way at high speed straight towards the RPD gunner, protecting the demolition team.
Having been briefed that anyone who broke through the roadblock was up to no good, the gunner opened up, and the driver, a Swiss national. Mr Max Zhiler, crashed into the side of the road.
He was very badly shot up and the soldiers raced to pull him from the vehicle before it caught fire. They planned to take him back to Rhodesia for treatment, but it was obvious he was beyond help and they could only make him as comfortable as possible before he died.
Twenty-four minutes after being dropped off, Pete Cole and Bob McKenna were lighting the fuses on the eight 48 kilogram charges. Then everyone pulled back a safe distance from the bridge to await the blast.
As they did so, two Zambian Air Force MiGs cruised high over the bridge.
The Rhodesians could hear their transmissions. No, the pilots told their base adamantly, they couldn’t see anything. No, they stressed, they didn’t believe there was anything going on at the bridge.
They did not descend to check out their statements and did not interfere in any way with the ground troops. When the SAS radioed for the Hunters to intercept the MiGs, the Zambians picked up the signal and quickly disappeared.
Suddenly, there was a blinding flash and some of the troops still moving away, stumbled forward as the shock wave hit them. Micro-seconds later, a deafening explosion tore across the Zambian countryside as almost 400 kilograms of TNT ripped the Chongwe River Bridge apart.
The operators turned to see the bridge erupt and the concrete and dust build up into a dark mushroom of nuclear proportions.
When the dust and debris finally settled, they saw that the bridge was a complete ruin and three of the five spans had been blown away.
If by now the SAS were beginning to feel the strain of all their activity, it was nothing to that felt by Kenneth Kaunda. Bridges were dropping all around him and he was forced to call for a general mobilisation.
Supporting Kaunda’s call the Government-owned _Zambia Daily Mail_ acknowledged that the country could not meet the demand for weapons to fight the invaders.
“We cannot wait. The enemy is already on our soil… for this reason is it necessary to revive the production of spears and poisonous arrows and make them available to the people.”
A ComOps spokesman laughed when told of the newspaper’s suggestion. “If any of our lads come down with arrow poisoning, we’ll complain to the Red Cross,” he said.

Signals monitored in Rhodesia warned all Zambian Army units to be vigilant and in a conversation between one police station and its headquarters in Lusaka, the situation was described as “double critical”.
The Zambians were certainly getting nervous. When an Australian TV journalist, Tony Joyce, went to film the wrecked Chongwe bridge, he was shot in the head by Zambian security forces, and died from his injuries in a London hospital.
A Zambian driver, his truck and valuable cargo of maize plunged over the gorge and the last reports were that he was seriously injured as he attempted to drive over the bridge, which, unbeknown to him, was no longer there.

Further north on the same road were Lieutenant Dale Scott and 15 men from “A” Squadron. They had arrived a few days earlier and after an ambush phase, “A” Squadron commander Major Rob Johnstone back in Kariba, came up on the radio to ask if they could destroy two small bridges that afternoon.
“A” Squadron was only too willing to oblige, and morale went up immediately. It was always nice to keep themselves occupied and they all welcomed the chance to blow the bridges.
The choppers brought in the explosives and a 12-man RLI callsign to help with the bridge demolitions. The RLI were to go to one bridge; the SAS to the other and they all set off to their targets carrying their mass of explosives.
The bridges were about two kilometres apart. Soon the commander gave the word to light the safety fuses. There was one blinding flash followed by an almighty bang as 400 kilograms of explosives tore the first tiny bridge apart. Then a couple of seconds later, there was a repeat performance and the second bridge was dumped.
Morale was very high as they climbed a nearby hill and settled down for the night They awoke to hear the sound of a bus speeding below them. It was overloaded with Africans and the driver had his foot fiat on the accelerator as he headed straight towards the gaping chasm where once the bridge had been.
Fortunately for him he saw the dust still hanging in the air, and at the last minute he managed to bring his bus to a halt just as the front wheels were a quarter of the way into space.
He clambered out through the back window and then shouted a warning to his passengers and everyone hurriedly debussed before their combined weight forced the vehicle into the riverbed.
Later, when it seemed they would have to wait for the choppers to collect them, the SAS decided to use the time to spring an ambush and part of the team split into two groups - one with five men, the other with six. Dale Scott was to command one, Dave Berry the other, each group acting as early-warning for the other.
Dave and team had hardly got things organised on their side of the road when they saw lights approaching. Then the voice of the commander came up on the radio.
“Take it out,” was all he said, and the ambushers felt that familiar surge of adrenalin as they hurried to a little embankment,
As the vehicle drew level, the butterflies suddenly vanished and the operators focused all their attention on the job at hand.
The man on the RPG-7 fired, but the headlights dazzled him and the rocket skimmed right under the vehicle. The RPD gunner immediately took out the driver and the vehicle crashed into the bank right in front of the ambushers who poured lead into the rear of the vehicle at a terrific rate. By then, the RPG-7 man had reloaded and put his second rocket into the cab. The vehicle immediately burst into flames.
By the time the shooting died down, ten of the 18 passengers lay dead, but it was difficult to establish if they were ZIPRA or Zambian Army. The SAS withdrew and spent a good part of the night listening to the rounds and grenades exploding in the blazing vehicle.
Another group demolished one more bridge north of Kariba- and that made ten bridges down altogether. In addition, the SAS had in the space of five days planted sixty landmines in Zambia.
The giant CGT-2 terror camp was also successfully bombed. Now the pressure was on and the Zambian Government was in a complete uproar.
Of the main bridges, only Chirundu and Victoria Falls were left intact, and it did not take much imagination on the Zambians’ part to work out who administered the mortgage on their security.
Not only was Zambia affected, but Malawi too. By demolishing the Chongwe River bridge, the SAS had put a halt to Malawi’s rice trade and also stopped Zambian exports via Beira in Mozambique. There were no road links to Tanzania either.
Thus the SAS had destroyed all Zambia’s economic arteries with Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique.
The Zambian President had definitely had enough, and subsequent intelligence revealed that he forced Nkomo to stay at the London conference, insisting on a successful conclusion.
The SAS, however, were not finished yet.
While the bridges were blowing, SAS Major Dave Dodson and his group were preparing for the next phase of aggression - the destruction of the massive Ndola Oil Refinery, the _only_ one in Zambia.
They had done their homework and knew all there was to know about the layout of the refinery and the dangers they were likely to encounter in such a heavily-populated Copperbelt town.
Dave and eleven saboteurs were going to parachute into Zaire in the evening, bury their chutes and infiltrate into Zambia, walking the twenty kilometres (12 miles) to Ndola to get them there before dark.
The plan was to meet up with a civilian contact man, then, under cover of darkness, destroy the oil refinery using rockets and explosives.
Once their mission was accomplished, their only means of escape would have been to head back to the safety of Zaire and hide up in the jungle until things cooled down.
It would have been the final straw for Zambia. First ten bridges down; then their sole oil refinery ablaze. For the Rhodesians, it was going to be the icing on the cake.
Then on November 22, came an urgent flash from ComOps. All offensive action had to cease and all callsigns deployed in Zambia had to be withdrawn immediately.
The only exception was if ZIPRA was caught crossing, All other action had to be cleared first by General Walls in London.
The Rhodesian offensive had received wide international press coverage, particularly the incidents involving the death of the Swiss national, Mr Max Zhiler, and the Zambians’ shooting of Australian journalist, Tony Joyce. The impact on Zambian and Malawian trade was made much of too.
Finally, the British brought pressure to bear on the Rhodesian delegation at the Lancaster House conference and the hierarchy ordered that the operation be called off before it could be taken to its ultimate conclusion.
But by then, the SAS’s brilliantly-contrived surgical operation had destroyed the secondary access bridges to the border and they had largely achieved the aim and stopped a vast majority of ZIPRA entering Rhodesia.
There was thus no way, without a very complicated manoeuvre, that any conventional force could have got into Rhodesia.
The threat had been blunted. The destruction of the massive arms cache outside Lusaka by the SAS and the dropping of the access bridges had kept ZIPRA at bay.
The ZIPRA threat now became secondary to that posed by Mugabe whose forces were flooding across the border. It was therefore essential to get the RLI and the helicopters out of Zambia and western Rhodesia to deal with the new ZANLA threat during a very critical period internally.
By prolonging the Lancaster House proceedings, ZANLA had been able to organise and consolidate the internal party and push men into the country in time for the ceasefire. An estimated 8 000 poured across the frontier into the _Thrasher_ area alone.
￼![410 - Dice](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/410%20-%20Dice.png)
The Zambians would never know how close they came to losing their precious oil. The SAS saboteurs tasked with the oil refinery job were just half an hour from leaving for Zaire when the word came to end the hostilities.
Spirits were high and they knew the job was more or less in the bag. Then Dave Dodson came in to tell them the mission was off.
The rest of his party thought he had to be joking. Normally when a job was cancelled they got more notice. But it was no joke and the excitement that went with such a dating operation gave way to bitter disappointment.
In Kariba too, the troops could hardly believe it was all over. They had all looked upon the Lancaster House conference as another Geneva, another charade in a faraway place. Now, just when they were getting stuck in to the big stuff, they were told to stop.
After they had finished with Zambia, they would have swept into Mozambique to continue the postponed Op Manacle, which, but for the sudden ZIPRA threat they would have already done and which would have left Mozambique in a very sorry state indeed.
The SAS had inflicted some ten million US dollars’ worth of communications damage on Zambia and the unit’s operations had a direct bearing on political developments over in London.
Apart from the economic pressure being brought to bear on Kaunda, Samora Machel could see what was happening in Zambia and didn’t need a crystal ball to work out that he was next. Indeed, a spy at ComOps level told him that the detailed planning had already been done.
Mozambique’s shaky economy simply could not afford that to happen. Apart from the poor state of the economy, the Rhodesian war was taking its toll (between 1976-1979 the war had inflicted on Mozambique damage estimated at forty-four million US dollars), and the Mozambique National Resistance movement, which was aided and abetted by the SAS, was growing and improving.
If anything Mozambique was even more vulnerable when it came to the destruction of bridges than Zambia. The river and bridges were far bigger than those in Zambia, making repair work extremely difficult to carry out. It would have taken years, not months - as in Zambia’s case - to put right.
Over in London, Mugabe had been proving difficult. He was against signing an agreement as it stood and was all set to fly to America to drum up support for continuing the war. He planned to go to the United Nations to get moral and financial support. He needed a forum where he could could publicly and immediately state why he was not prepared to go along with the Lancaster House agreement.
He was hoping that what he had to say would have a dramatic effect on all the politicos inside black Africa as well as the OAU. He hoped that this would be enough to put Machel back into a corner and force him to carry on assisting him.
But Machel had other ideas and lost no time in spelling out his terms. If Mugabe did not sign, he would kick ZANLA out of Mozambique and they would no longer have that country as a launching pad.
Machel’s new attitude must have taken some soul-searching. But he had no choice. Without dropping one Mozambican bridge, the Rhodesians had achieved their aim of forcing Machel to consider abandoning ZANLA.
For Robert Mugabe, there were no options left either. He could not afford to upset Machel and it was totally unacceptable to lose the support of his host and his platform. ZANLA would be disarmed, held in custody as refugees and in three months at the outside, Mugabe would have no army left.
Both Nkomo and Mugabe heeded their hosts’ wishes and stayed at the conference table to sign the ceasefire.
Dropping a few bridges and the threat of dropping others had finally set the wheels in motion for a ceasefire and the end of the fiercest war on the sub-continent.
A month later, Robert Mugabe, Joshua Nkomo and Bishop Abel Muzorewa signed a ceasefire agreement It was December 21, seven years to the day since terrorists attacked Altena Farm, north of Centenary, and the war had begun in earnest.
External raids had already been scaled down and eventually suspended in the light of the changing political climate. Only the SAS continued to work externally with the Mozambique National Resistance.
The Commonwealth monitoring force - including British Special Air Service soldiers wearing the uniforms of other units - had begun to arrive to supervise the winding down of hostilities.
Even before the ceasefire, the British Governor Lord Soames had taken up residence in Salisbury, with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington wishing him a “Good on you”. He would need it. With his arrival, Rhodesia’s decade-and-a-half of rebellion against the Crown, one of the most defiant acts in modem political history, was over.
Sanctions were to be lifted and the Rhodesian albatross was about to slip from Britain’s neck...
