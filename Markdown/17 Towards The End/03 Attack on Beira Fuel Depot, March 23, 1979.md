The Mozambique National Resistance was now about to begin a new phase in the fight for the control of Mozambique.  
Until now, MNR attacks had been confined to targets in small towns and rural areas, and although important installations like the Mavuze Power station had been attacked, the rebels had never hit vital strategic points in major cities, which if successfully destroyed, would deliver a telling blow to FRELIMO and have a ripple effect on the whole country.  
But that approach was about to change and the war to topple Samora Machel and install a pro-Western government was to take on a new and daring aggressiveness.  
The MNR and their SAS colleagues were planning a top secret and highly sensitive operation, one of the most daring ever mounted in Africa. The SAS were well used to dangerous and varied operations far from home. yet the sheer size of the main target and the audacity of the plan astounded even them.  
In a bold and unprecedented show of force, the SAS and MNR were to infiltrate right to the doorstep of FRELIMO’s second largest port, Beira, a very heavily populated and well-defended city on the Mozambique coast.  
They had their sights set on the most important target in Beira. And yet. they wanted more.  
Having infiltrated so far, two of the most formidable fighting forces on the continent aimed to make their presence felt by attacking as many important economic and strategic targets and inflicting as much damage as humanly possible, before their time ran out.  
Then, as stealthily as they had arrived, they would melt away.  
The cost to FRELIMO, of such a visit, would - if all went well - be astronomical: the benefits to the rebel organisation from a propaganda point of view alone, enormous.  
The major prize was the giant Munhava Oil Storage Depot, a mere two kilometres from downtown Beira, housing more than forty fuel tanks and several sheds full of 200 litre fuel drums. It represented an investment of many millions of dollars and the FRELIMO government, already in dire economic and financial straits, could ill afford such a crippling loss.  
For the Rhodesians, it represented the biggest single economic target they had taken on in their war: for the MNR, it would be the first of many in a long list in their campaign to oust FRELIMO.  
When the SAS and MNR studied their maps, they realised there were more than a dozen other vitally-important installations worthy of their attention. But because they were spread over such a wide area and, as the raiders would be working on a very rigid timescale, mission commander Captain Bob McKenna eventually decided on a much more feasible plan.  
He was still left with an impressive list of targets all close to the fuel depot, and given the time, they aimed to blow up a transformer station which supplied Beira with electricity ... topple an electricity pylon… sabotage a railway junction over which all trains travelled to and from the docks... set a coal dump ablaze, and sever a pipeline leading from the oil depot to the wharfs.  
And while they were at it, they also intended aiding the Rhodesian war effort by destroying ZANLA’s main warehouse, crammed to capacity with arms and general stores. The ZANLA warehouse was in a long row of warehouses but the MNR intelligence was good and they knew exactly which building to hit.  
It would be an extremely high-risk operation and taking on a target in an urban area was an entirely different proposition to a rural attack, where the strike force could melt into the endless bush and shrub after making their hit. In an urban setting, the scales would be tipped more in favour of FRELIMO.  
Small armed groups patrolled the city streets on the look-out for trouble ... and there were known to be FRELIMO guards on duty around the fuel depot itself.  
Just to make life more difficult for any would-be attacker, there was a FRELIMO trench system and 37 millimetre anti-aircraft battery a mere 800 metres from the fuel depot, which was manned around the clock by protecting troops. It was the biggest threat of all, and would have to be taken very seriously.  
Then there were thousands of shanty dwellers not 300 metres from the depot who could raise the alarm even before their attack went in: and, there was the very real MiG threat.  
Beira was a very long way from Rhodesia and the MNR’s bases in the Mozambique hinterland, and timings would be absolutely critical.  
They would have less than four hours to get into Beira from their pre-determined arrival point, do the job, and get clear of the area before the MiGs could be scrambled from Beira airport and before the thousands of locally-based FRELIMO could react.  
As it was, they were expecting FRELIMO in the A/A position near the main target to open up on them while they were still attacking the fuel depot.  
It was a formidable target with countless risks involved and like all major external operations far from home, and without the benefit of air support, a thousand things could go wrong.  
Yet in spite of all the dangers, mission commander Bob McKenna was confident that they could pull the task off.  
Apart from their own abilities, they would have the protection of an almost moonless night to cover their infiltration and exfiltration phase.  
They would also have the benefit of total surprise on their side. The mission would involve a very deep penetration and long infiltration phase and as the SAS themselves very well knew, the further inland they went, the greater was the element of surprise, particularly the first time a new place was hit and the security was not all it might be.  
The Rhodesian Air Force, flying low level and under radar cover, would put them down near the Pungwe River some distance from the target. Then they would march into the area. The Resistance, specially chosen for the mission because of their knowledge of the region, would again act as guides and “faces” among any locals they might encounter, while the all-white, albeit blackened-up SAS remained under cover.  
Before attacking the fuel depot, they were to lay an assortment of suitcase bombs and incendiaries around the secondary targets, which were set to go off at varying intervals over the following two days.  
Bob McKenna was gambling that by the time the FRELIMO anti-aircraft gunners opened up on them, the SAS and Resistance would have done their worst and would be ready to make tracks.  
The Resistance was to take advantage of any buffer time to distribute resistance leaflets and badges around the blazing fuel depot.  
Exfiltration would be much the same as their entry, involving a long march out and then recovery by aircraft.  
Having got their entry and exit routes sorted out, the high-powered planning of the finer details of the mission and the intensive rehearsals began in earnest.  
A formidable target called for a formidable team and Bob selected a group of men who had over the years proved themselves under fire on numerous operations into Mozambique. The track record of the assembled team was outstanding, and apart from men with particular specialities there were also two squadron commanders - Bob McKenna himself and Captain Colin Willis.  
Planning the operation was very much a team effort and although Bob drew up the final plan and gave the orders, it had been discussed among all the officers in the team during the many long hours of exhaustive rehearsals.  
Their intelligence on the fuel depot and subsidiary targets was excellent and told them most things they needed to know.  
Their plans and aerial photographs showed them the entire lay-out of the main target: the only details they were unable to assess accurately was which fuel tanks were full, and which were not, and which would have been emptied by the time they got to the target.  
They had a few questions about some of the structures on the aerial pictures and a visit to the experts at Salisbury’s own fuel farm, under the guise of being on an anti-sabotage course, cleared up those points. The Salisbury oil men told them that some of the tanks contained tar and pitch and advised which tanks would burn best.  
The Salisbury fuel farm had been virtually destroyed the previous December by a terrorist attack and having seen the terrible devastation that could be inflicted with just a couple of RPG-7 rockets and a few smallarms rounds, the operators were confident that what they had in mind for the Beira depot would cause considerably greater havoc. The psychological damage to FRELIMO alone would be grevious indeed.  
They intended using a heavy mixture of RPG rockets, armour-piercing RPD machinegun fire and AK tracers at the Beira depot` and after some useful technical advice from the boffins, they worked out a plan that was designed to inflict the most damage in the shortest possible time.  
Then, using a model based on their aerial photographs, they went over and over what they would do come the night - the sequence of events... their timings... the routes they would take to get to the main and subsidiary targets... the positions each man would take up outside the depot... how far they would be from the security wall ... which fuel tanks each would shoot at first ...  
Every minor detail had to be thrashed out and their contingency plans had to cater for every possible eventuality. They had to consider what to do if compromised, what the arrangement was if they got separated or if their escape route was blocked... and the rendezvous procedures. Their comprehensive training included tuition from Salisbury police on the finer points of car stealing, a skill that would enable them to make a rapid escape if things got too hot.  
They planned to take plenty of ammunition along in reserve in case they had to fight their way out.  
Eventually, all the rehearsals, some of the most thorough of the entire war, were at an end, and every man knew exactly what he was to do and when he was to do it.  
Then, their local homework over, the mission commander boarded a Canberra and carried out a night-time aerial reconnaissance over Beira to check the lighting around the main target and the surrounding area.  
For lighting was crucial to the success of the operation. Too much and they would be seen: too little and they would be unable to see what they were doing.  
The commander need not have worried. The lighting was perfect for their particular purpose. There was a whole battery of lights strung around the walled fuel depot, but the security people had made the rather foolish and elementary error of positioning them so that they shone _inwards_  
The target was thus completely illuminated making the saboteur’s job easy for them. It was a very thoughtful gesture, Bob remarked at the time, and he had no doubt that heads would roll because of it.  
Apart from a string of security lights along the nearby warehouses and shunting yards, virtually everything else in the vicinity was in total darkness. The soft glow from the city would enable them to see what they were doing and they were hoping there would be just enough starlight to aid their activities.  
Bob returned home from his recce extremely excited, knowing that he could not have arraigned the lighting any better himself.  
Within days, the last-minute preparations had been completed and one of the most exhilirating, daring operations of the war was under way. Bob and his SAS/MNR team boarded the aircraft en route to Beira and after a long journey, they arrived on the outskirts of Munhava a few days later.  
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
The fringes of Mozambique’s second largest port lay silent and still, the quietness of the night magnifying every sound. The attack team could just make out the hazy glow from the city lights beyond the black hulks of the buildings.  
The atmosphere was now thick with tension and there was a fair amount of excitement in the air. The earlier infiltration phase had gone well and they had arrived without incident, save for a small navigational problem which had put them well behind schedule. It was an added worry and served to heighten the tension.  
Beira had been built on a mangrove swamp and entry to the low-lying coastal city was through a network of muddy, black and very smelly river beds and slippery, steep hills. They were soon wading through the mud and slipping and sliding all over the hills. The heat and humidity of Beira was intense and hit them immediately. The perspiration poured off them running into their eyes and noses and making streaks in their camouflage cream as they struggled and slithered on their way.  
Several men had to be hauled out of the mud with the aid of their rifles and by the time they had negotiated the mud and slime, they were all extremely tired.  
It had taken them a great deal longer to get through the mud than they had expected and Bob McKenna ordered his men to take a short rest. They could not really afford another delay but Bob wanted them at peak fitness for the hard work ahead.  
As they regained their strength and brushed off the mud already beginning to cake dry on their FRELIMO uniforms, Bob McKenna carefully thought things over.  
Apart from millions of mosquitoes waiting to greet them, they had arrived in Beira undetected and there were no other enemies to stop their progress. He now knew that apart from a major set-back, the fuel depot was in the bag He would worry about the pull-out phase and possible enemy reaction later.  
But the delays had seriously affect¢d their original time appreciation and they were now ninety minutes behind schedule. It meant they had only two-and-a-half hours to do their damage and get clear under cover of darkness. There was simply too much to do and too little time to do it in.  
The commander signalled his men that it was time to get going again and the heavily armed group staggered to their feet, eager to be gone. The tension was now unbearable.  
Then, with their rifles at the ready and the MNR contingent guiding them to their pre-arranged dispersal point, they made their way through the back streets of downtown Beira. Now that their muddy hurdle was behind them, they made rapid progress.  
As they moved through the darkness and along the unlit streets with silent purpose, the commander considered which of the subsidiary targets he could afford to cancel. Time, not generosity, was the deciding factor and he finally allowed FRELIMO to keep their electricity transformer, the railway junction and coal dump and ZANLA their warehouse.  
However, there would still be time for Colin Willis and his MNR/SAS crew to lay their suitcase bomb on the fuel pipeline running from the depot to the wharfs; and for another group commanded by Pete Cole to go in the opposite direction and rig up their explosives on an electricity pylon.  
At the dispersal point the commander gave the teams their final modified orders, their last word of encouragement and wished them well.  
Colin Willis mumbled a reply, gathered up his men, then led his team to the east while the others headed north.  
As the overall commander and the main team took up their places and sought the cover of the long grass on a small bank at the edge of a rice paddy, Pete Cole and his group peeled off towards the nearest electricity pylon.  
The commander was much relieved to find that nothing had changed since his aerial reconnaissance. All the floodlights were still shining inwards, brilliantly illuminating the massive fuel tanks behind the security wall.  
The guards in their pillboxes and sentries on their beats had not noticed the dark shapes of armed men as they took up their places in the blackness. So far, so good. Bob McKenna told himself.  
As they lay in a line waiting for the others to join them, only their eyes moved, each man taking in the scene before him and zeroing in on the tank he was to shoot at first The Beira fuel farm was enormous. It had to be a good five times bigger than the one back home in Salisbury. The frontage stretched some 800 metres and the silver grey tanks, of varying sizes, were in rows as far as the eye could see.  
There was not a sound, not a movement from the confines of the depot In the eerie silence behind the security wall, the huge vulnerable tanks lay waiting their fate. It would not be long now, the operators thought as they quietly envisaged the exploding, roaring inferno that was about to erupt before them.  
Some of them began to worry if they were far enough away from the target: if the tanks would blow up and if they would be engulfed by flames, for the tanks were so enormous they seemed dangerously close.  
Every so often, the late-night dockland noises punctuated their thoughts. Although it was almost midnight, life in downtown Beira seemed as lively as it undoubtedly was during the day.  
Only a small swampy rice field and a road separated the strike force from Beira’s densely-populated shanty town, and the soldiers could clearly hear people shouting and laughing. Dogs were barking and chickens squawking. There was a fair old racket going on at the beerhall, too.  
Now and then the door would swing open and the light would momentarily stream out as someone lurched away into the night Pete Cole, scaling the nearby electricity pylon, paused for a moment and followed the progress of one of the late-night revellers until the man’s silhouette merged with the darkness.  
There was much activity too at the city rubbish dump further along the road. The SAS and MNR could hear the refuse trucks rolling up and down the road 100 metres behind them, emptying their loads, then leaving to make another pick-up.  
They could make out the silhouette of a refuse collector as he dangled precariously from the backstep of the truck, but the man could not see them as they lay low in the long grass.  
When Pete Cole’s group had finished laying their explosives and setting the time delay at the pylon, they joined the main party at the fuel farm. Then they waited for Colin Willis and his team to take up their position on the opposite side of the target.  
The attack was to be launched from two sides and it was imperative, that both assaults go in at the same time for maximum effect in their limited time-frame.  
It was due to start at 23h30, but 23h30 came and went and still the other group was not in position. Everyone silently began to wonder what was keeping Colin Willis and his crew.  
Mission commander, Bob McKenna glanced at his watch once more and began to get nervous. As the troops lay waiting for the signal to come, the tension was almost unbearable. Their pulses raced and trickles of sweat gathered along their spines.  
The mosquitoes whined persistently around their ears and, beyond the swampy ricefield in the shanty town, a dog barked.  
Meanwhile Colin Willis and his party having had further to travel was going as fast as caution would allow. But they faced a far greater risk of discovery and their movement had been slower.  
From the dispersal point they had to travel along the entire frontage of the fuel farm, and as they had no idea where the FRELIMO guards were patrolling, it was essential to make many listening stops.  
The fuel pipeline which they planned to sever with their suitcase bomb was also very close to FRELIMO’s anti-aircraft battery, and their journey was of necessity particularly cautious.  
Colin pulled out his wire cutters and cut an entrance through a security fence protecting the pipeline. Then he deftly tucked the suitcase bomb underneath the pipe, camouflaging it well and set the fuse.  
He returned to the rest of his team and then, as cautiously as before, he led his men into their positions for the attack on the main target  
Before the attack could begin, he had to be absolutely certain that each of his men could positively identify his correct targets. For there were lethal tanks of liquid gas on their side of the fuel farm and they knew that if they accidentally hit them. someone would be picking up their pieces in Salisbury before morning.  
Just to make sure they avoided the killer gas, they crept to within fifty metres of the security fence, which unlike that on the opposite side of the target was made of wire, not brick.  
At 23h45, Colin called the mission commander on the radio on the opposite side of the fuel farm to report that they were now in position and ready.  
As he heard Colin’s voice, Bob McKenna’s nervousness suddenly vanished. Relieved that all was well, he gave the order to standby. On the opposite side of the target, Colin and his team braced themselves for the signal that would come any moment.  
The commander took up a kneeling position and as he pointed his RPG-7 at the nearest fuel tank, he heard a dozen safety catches click off around him.  
Then he fired his first rocket and even before it struck the tank, the rest of his men were joining in, pouring a non-stop hail of RPG-7 rockets, armour-piercing machinegun fire, and coloured tracers at the tanks.  
A split second later, Colin and crew on the opposite side of the fuel farm were doing the same.  
Within seconds, the commander’s target had begun to melt from the top like a giant slab of milk chocolate and within a minute, it had virtually disintegrated.  
The heat was intense as first one then another monster tank burst uncontrollably into flames and petrol gushed out of the holes, only to ignite as the saboteurs continued raking the tanks with fire, keeping up their merciless attack.  
By now the flames had consumed so much air, that a breeze had sprung up and was blowing towards the fuel depot.  
Tracers were criss-crossing the night sky and there were terrific flashes of light as rockets exploded into the fuel tanks.  
Some of the tanks exploded immediately, and soon, massive belching black clouds hung over the fuel farm, reflecting the reddish hue of the blaze back on to the landscape and the attackers as they lay and knelt on the now-warm soil.  
As soon as the tanks began igniting, the entire area was lit up as if it were broad daylight.  
Colin Willis was rather taken aback by the incredible amount of light that was thrown up so quickly, and as he glanced around and saw his men firing, he suddenly realised how vulnerable they were, silhouetted as they were like black dots in an open field just eighty metres from the security fence. They would have made perfect targets for the odd FRELIMO bold enough to take them on.  
But there was such a weight of fire being directed at the fuel depot that the guards in the various pillboxes around the security fence generally kept their heads down or ran away: they never became a problem. Just to ensure they kept out of it, the strike force gave the guard towers the odd burst now and then.  
There must have been a fair amount of noise too, but the operators were concentrating so much on the job, and firing so rapidly, they later could not remember hearing any.  
The Rhodesian security force officers in the command Dakota over Mozambican skies were to congratulate Bob for the spectacular show the SAS and MNR put on that night.  
Suddenly, the FRELIMO manning the 37 millimetre anti-aircraft guns in their trenches not 300 metres from Colin Willis and crew woke up and began firing wildly into the air. Initially they thought that the depot had been bombed.  
Their high explosive shells were streaking across the night sky in every direction. Brilliant orange flashes from the flak were bursting over the city as they proceeded to give the attackers and the whole of Beira an impressive fireworks display.  
The strike force meanwhile was putting on its show, the likes of which Beira had not seen before and would not forget in a hurry. They maintained the momentum of their attack and soon there were at least eight fires roaring through the fuel farm.  
By now, Bob McKenna had decided that the mission had definitely been accomplished and with a final look at his watch to see how they were doing, he gave the order to pull out.  
His team, attuned at all times to the word of command, quickly obeyed. They travelled down the length of the fuel farm and having got themselves in another vantage point, stopped just long enough to have a final go at the tanks. They hoped that by firing from a different angle they would be able to hit the tanks previously obscured from view.  
Bob bellowed a final command, then they were on their way again, pausing only to fire warning shots over the heads of some of the shanty dwellers standing idly on the side of the road watching the fireworks. The not-so-curious, however, continued their partying in the beerhall regardless, as if such goings-on were everyday occurrences.  
Across the far side of the fuel farm, behind the blazing tanks, Colin Willis had passed on the pull-out command to his team. As they began withdrawing towards the RV point, the FRELIMO gunners suddenly realised that the attack was coming from the ground and not the air and began to depress their anti-aircraft guns and fire towards Colin and his team.  
For one horrifying moment, Colin and his crew had their hearts in their mouths as sheets of 37 miilimetre tracer went hell for leather over their heads. They knew that if FRELIMO lowered their barrels, they would be in real trouble.  
￼![268 - beira](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/268%20-%20beira.png)  
But FRELIMO could not depress their barrels much further and as the relieved soldiers hurried on their way, FRELIMO shells whistled overhead and began exploding beyond both teams.  
Other shells shot across the fuel farm and landed in the shanty town: and subsequent intelligence told that FRELIMO managed to kill 18 of their own countrymen.  
Sadly for the attackers, some of the FRELIMO fire was accurate and one MNR man in Bob’s party was killed and an SAS operator injured. Sadly, too, the heat was on and the operators were moving too fast to take the dead man along with them.  
Bob and the main team hurried away, helping their wounded man along... while FRELIMO shells continued exploding ahead of them and giant flames licked the night sky behind. By now, the fuel tanks resembled melting candles on a giant birthday cake.  
Back at the RV point there was little time to talk. Time was against them and they still had to struggle through the slippery mud hills and river beds before they could even begin to feel safe.  
The return journey was as difficult as their earlier trip and Colin Willis fell into a muddy hole and snapped a ligament in his leg. Yet despite the hardships of the mud, they took great comfort in looking back at the enormous blazing fire and the clouds of black smoke belching up into the night sky.  
As the raiders silently disappeared into the night, a muffled explosion rolled across the countryside. It was a small affair compared to the others that had rocked Beira that night, but they knew their suitcase bombs on the fuel pipeline had gone off.  
Within a few hours, their night’s work would be complete as the explosives on the electricity pylon would detonate and the pylon would topple over, cutting electricity to the city. But by then the men responsible for all Beira’s troubles would be well on their way back to their bases. They had done a good job and there would be much to celebrate atop Gorongoza mountain and in the various SAS messes.  
Next morning, the pall of black smoke that hung over the twisted heaps of charred metal was clearly visible in Umtali 300 kilometres (186 miles) away.  
It had been a difficult operation, faultlessly carried out despite the long approach and the presence of the FRELIMO anti-aircraft batteries so close to the target. Bob McKenna subsequently received the Silver Cross of Rhodesia, the country’s second highest gallantry honour, which was partly awarded for the success of the mission and his conduct during such trying conditions.  
_The Voice of Free Africa_ was the first to spread the news of the attack, and within days every major newspaper in the southern hemisphere was desperately trying to get photographs of the inferno - and were prepared to pay handsomely for them, too.  
Despite the widespread success of  _The Voice of Free Africa_ inside Mozambique, the rest of the world had known little of the Mozambique National Resistance and its aims. The successful attack on the Beira fuel depot, a turning point in their confrontation with FRELIMO, had changed all that.  
FRELIMO refused to allow photographs to be taken of the blaze, which caused an estimated three million Rhodesian dollars in damages and losses.  
They vainly attempted to put the blaze out and although they had a water reservoir available to them, they lacked the expertise to extinguish the fire. Adding to their initial worries, too, was the fact that the electricity supply needed to pump water to the tanks had been blown up and the pipeline down to the sea had been severed, seriously hampering their firefighting capabilities.  
Most of the fuel was destined for FRELIMO but some had belonged to Malawi, and FRELIMO was finally forced to call in a team of South African firefighters together with twenty tonnes of specialised equipment to put the blaze out. By the time the South Africans got there, the fire had been raging for 36 hours. Fortunately for FRELIMO, the experts were able to extinguish it within hours.  
Intercepts revealed that a British-owned fuel tanker had dropped anchor in Beira to top up some of the empty tanks on the night of the attack. The enormous fires licking the skyline so startled the captain that he wisely decided to keep going.  
Had the raiders known about the ship, they would have waited until the tanks were full and caused even more havoc. Nevertheless, the fuel was not delivered - and it was a further loss to FRELIMO.  
It had been the most spectacular MNR success to date. It had further fuelled tensions in the region and if Samora Machel had harboured any doubts before, he had to admit that the MNR were indeed a force to be reckoned with, both in the rural and urban area - and that nowhere was out of reach or safe from an MNR strike.  
Dousing the flames of rebel action was not going to be easy.
