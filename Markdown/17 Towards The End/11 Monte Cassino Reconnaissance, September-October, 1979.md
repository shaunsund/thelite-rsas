Inspector Winston Hart of the national intelligence team, whose job had been to keep abreast of ZANLA camps in what had become known as the Chimoio Circle, had got wind the area was now in use again.
Repeated security force attacks had left previous Chimoio camps decimated and after SAS Lieutenant Rich Stannard had called in the jets to flatten several new camps which had sprung up, the area had gone quiet again.
But now, recent captured documents and prisoners told that another large base had been established and there were three separate camps. Such was the importance of the New Chimoio that ZANLA commanders Josiah Tongogara and Rex Nhongo slept there, and captured documents indicated that New Chimoio was the most important ZANLA camp in Mozambique.
If it could be located and destroyed, it would drastically curtail the ZANLA seepage into the _Thrasher_ operational area. Incursions were taking place countrywide and the Rhodesians were still desperately trying to halt the flow at source.
But while the national intelligence team was beginning to build up an accurate picture of the layout and personalities involved, the exact location of the New Chimoio remained a mystery.
Captured terrorists could only give a vague indication of where it was.
“We walked from Vanduzi then across the railway line… travelled in a truck for half an hour. Then we went to the power lines, walked up them for another half an hour or so and .... “ that was as close as Winston Hart and his team got.
The Rhodesians knew the new camp was bounded by certain rivers… was on the side of a hill ... and on the east side of the Chimoio-Tete road. But it was all rather sketchy.
They didn’t want to put up a photographic-reconnaissance plane either. Spirit mediums attached to ZANLA bases had the knack of using them to trick ZANLA with their talents, to the frustration of the Rhodesian war effort.
“Ah!” they would say when they heard the high flying planes, “I think we might be attacked.” The rank and file would be impressed with their amazing prophetic magical powers - and the camp would be quickly vacated.
Then there were John and Janet, the two tame baboons, used in an early-warning role, to consider. The Rhodesians certainly didn’t want a couple of frenzied animals giving the game away.
The latest information was that there were 2 000 ZANLA in the New Chimoio and a decision was made to send an SAS reconnaissance team into the area to try and pinpoint the camp.
The team was also to spring an ambush on a path on the outskirts of the suspected camp in the hope of getting to grips with one of the Toyota Landcruisers which invariably carried the elusive ZANLA hierarchy.
Lieutenant Andrew Sanders of “A” Squadron was to command the team and, in addition to the 11 SAS operators, there would also be four members of the Mozambique National Resistance movement with them.
Judging by the old Portuguese maps available to them, they were going into a heavily populated area and the four MNR could prove useful for wheedling intelligence from locals.
“A” Squadron commander, Rob Johnstone decided to set up a radio relay station for the op, something seldom used by the SAS.
Operating in-depth into hostile territory as they did, their lifeline with home and help was the heavy HF radio enabling them to have communications over vast distances. But an antenna had to be set up... and that took time.
Rob Johnstone felt that were things to go wrong and it became a mobile war, the callsign might not have time to rig up an antenna.
The answer was to use the lighter, short-range radio with a ground-to-air capability which had a fixed aerial. With a relay station in position on a hill inside Rhodesia near the border, the reconnaissance team could send their messages to the relay team ... and they would pass it back to the squadron commander based at Grand Reef airstrip.
Bruce Langley, Hennie Pretorius, Barry Deacon and Rob Hepple were to man the relay station on a mountain in Rhodesia, 15 kilometres (nine miles) or so from the intended ambush position.
Andrew Sanders, the mission 21C, Dave Berry and their team, plus the MNR chaps, were choppered into Mozambique a good 45 minutes before last light, and set off walking immediately.
There was very little moon that night and progress was slow. At 23h00 the light was so bad they were forced to call a halt. They bedded down for the night and next day got an early start, striking out for a range of hills they had to cross to reach a path on the fringe of the new camp, where they would mount their ambush.
But first, the team had to work their way through a heavily built-up area, and progress was at a snairs pace. Then they crossed a new and well-used road not marked on their maps and arrived at the foothills of the mountain range.
Having scaled a large hill, the commander decided to remain there for the rest of the day rather than cross the range to the path where they planned to spring their ambush.
The area was far too busy for their liking, and it would be dicey to move around during the day.
Later, twenty armed ZANLA suddenly appeared below one of the early-warning groups. Some were prodding the road for landmines, others were walking behind them in extended line searching the bush.
Having heard the Rhodesian choppers the previous day, it was only natural that ZANLA would be expecting landmines to have been laid in the night. But the SAS were a bit taken aback to find them doing it just there.
It could only mean that the suspected camp was probably a lot closer to the border than the intelligence team imagined.
The operators decided to observe the road for a further day before making a plan of action. The MNR suggested they speak to the locals and within a couple of hours they were back to report that the New Chimoio terror camp was about five kilometres away.
At 08h00 next day, a ten-man ZANLA clearance patrol walked up the ridgestraight into one of the early-warning positions. The SAS had no choice but to open up and by the end of the action, two enemy lay dead and the others beat a hasty retreat.
Almost immediately, heavy weapons on a nearby mountain were brought to bear on the attackers.
That was it, the SAS thought; the whole scene had been blown. The enemy knew their exact position and there was no hope of remaining in the area for an ambush now.
The commander and his 2IC had a quick discussion and decided to move down to the road. There was a chance the team might still get something in the way of a target, and as long as there was that chance, they would try and do the best they could.
They knew they really ought to be pulling out. ZANLA might decide to follow-up. The commander realised it was going to be very dicey. They didn’t know exactly how many people were in the enemy camp; didn’t know what the odds were...
Quickly, the SAS and MNR moved down the hill going towards the camp, not away from it. Suddenly the unmistakable sound of vehicles starting up came from the direction of the camp.
It was an opportunity not to be missed, but not knowing how many vehicles there were, it was worrying, too, considering the size of their callsign and the fact that they only had one RPG-7 among them. The RPG-7 man would just have to make his first shot count; but he was an expert and hadn’t let them down yet.
An hour later they had arrived at the road. The two commanders did a quick reconnaissance and found the best available ambush position possible.
Andrew Sanders and Dave Berry showed each man exactly where he must go and told Dave Bradley manning the RPG-7 rocket launcher where his position was; then the team moved back from the road.
The troops quickly put claymores out on their flanks and one to the rear to cover them. Then began the wait.
A civilian who had been buying clothes in the terror camp wandered into their ambush and was captured. He would prove a useful gift for their SB friends.
About ninety minutes later, the sound of vehicles could be heard crunching nearer to the killing ground.
Immediately, everyone took off for his fire position, sinking low, pressing his body flush to the ground, heart beating a little faster as it always did in the final moments before an attack.
Five minutes later, two Toyota Landcruisers came roaring along the road.
As the vehicles entered the killing ground, the second one attempted to overtake the first. But by then, Dave Bradley had already stepped out on to the road with his RPG7 rocket launcher.
There was a distinctive _whoosh_ as his rocket struck the engine and radiator of the first vehicle. The vehicle, which had been doing about forty kilometres (25 miles) an hour, came to a dead stop and reared back.
An escort perched on the customary 200-1itre fuel drum at the back shot into the air and took off down the road as fast as his legs could carry him. He was to be the only lucky one that day.
The first Landcruiser and its fuel drums burst into flames.
There were three bodies in the front and another five in the back. So intense was the heat from the fuel fire, and so fiercely were the bodies burning, that the ambushers were unable to get near to carry out a search of either bodies or vehicle.
The RPD gunners had by now killed the driver and occupants of the second Landcruiser... and the drum of petrol on the back had burst into flames.
One man managed to leap out, fleeing down the road for his life. A tracer followed him and he fell, mortally wounded.
Within seconds it was all over. The two ZANLA vehicles were engulfed in flames. And 14 enemy lay dead.
Dave Berry got to within twenty metres of the second vehicle to try and capture documents or weaponry, but was driven back by the flames. He thought he saw the body of a white man lying across the seat, but couldn’t be sure.
Everyone collected up his kit and withdrew in double-quick time.
The commander called up the SAS relay team on their mountain with a request to send in the choppers post haste. The message was passed on to “A” Squadron commander, Rob Johnstone, who got into a Lynx to orbit the area while his men withdrew.
Back inside Mozambique, the fifteen ambushers were hurrying towards the border in search of a suitable landing zone for the choppers. Within a kilometre they had found an open piece of ground. They ought to have continued on and found another LZ further from the ambush site, but the team had got on to what had to be the highest piece of ground in the area and it would be ideal.
They cleared the area and took up all-round defensive positions. Then they laid low in the long grass and waited for the choppers to arrive for the pick-up.
Suddenly, the soldiers on the east of the landing zone saw men approaching. They were only 100 metres away from them.
“Psst... psst!” It was the usual hissed warning to the rest of the callsign that told of trouble. Everyone was alert and waiting. Every finger on a trigger.
A team of women trackers was also closing in on them. Dave Berry began inching his way up to the soldiers on the east. As he did so, the enemy suddenly opened fire. The SAS returned the fire and six ZANLA went down.
Then the two sides fought it out ZANLA- their numbers soon boosted by new arrivals - put down an intensive volume of fire and began to encircle the 15 soldiers with mortars, rifle grenades, heavy weapons and smallarms. The battle lasted for ten minutes; but for those involved, it felt more like an hour.
It was clear the Rhodesians couldn’t take on all the opposition. The commander yelled at his men to withdraw, and his troops, attuned at all times to what he had to say, took off after him as he led his pack through the long grass. It had become a running battle and the callsign was under very heavy fire.
Back inside Rhodesia on the hill overlooking Mozambique, the relay team could see the clouds of dust as they followed the progress of the ZANLA mortars pursuing the fleeing ambushers across the countryside.
When squadron commander Rob Johnstone appeared overhead in the Lynx, the firing momentarily let up.
The four choppers would be with them in a couple of minutes, he reported. But one of the pilots refused to take his chopper down as long as there was firing on the ground.
“You’ll get there and take the bloody choppers in,” Rob Johnstone radioed from the Lynx, concerned for the safety of his men.
“Is there any firing?” enquired the pilot a bit later, equally as concerned about the fate of his aircraft
“No,” Rob Johnstone lied.
With the prisoner, there were now 16 men who had to be snatched to safety. The choppers were flying with minimum fuel in an effort to pick everyone up and avoid two lifts. Even if kit was jettisoned, the choppers would be hard pressed to get the extra passenger back to the border.
But the capture absconded during the running punch-up and the problem was solved.
The soldiers had been running for about one kilometre, through maize fields... through a ZANLA training ground… hotly pursued by an angry, determined enemy. And still the operators hadn’t found a suitable landing zone. Then came the sound of the choppers and the relief of knowing that they were all but safe.
With a bit of coaxing and a couple more white lies from the “A” Squadron commander in the Lynx, the pilots swooped down for the rescue… and were not amused to find the battle still raging.
ZANLA were 150 metres away from the callsign and still firing at the ambushers. Even before the choppers touched down, the soldiers had tossed in their packs.
A couple of helicopters struggled to lift off. Batteries, rations and a few packs were jettisoned. The choppers lifted. Suddenly, the technicians spotted a bunch of ZANLA and blasted them with their twin Brownings... while the troops fired from the hip cowboy fashion, through the open door.
The smoke from the battle still hung in the air as the aircraft turned and set course for home. It had been a close thing and the team had been lucky they had taken no casualties. But for the timely arrival of  _The Blues_, it might have been very different.
Intercepts revealed that three Russian advisers had been killed in the ambush. One was believed to be a general.
The intelligence team couldn’t quite understand what a ZANLA sweepline had been doing so far from the camp site, and a Selous Scouts team under John Gardner, formerly of the SAS, was put in for a close-in recce - and the Scouts also had to be hot extracted.
In the end, despite the possibility of alerting ZANLA, an aerial photographic reconnaissance was flown and although only a portion of the camp could be seen through the cloud cover, it revealed five very heavily defended camps with antiaircraft guns dug into solid rock in the hills overlooking the tree-covered plains. The Rhodesians would later learn that the Soviets had advised ZANLA in their defences.
The camp was dominated by a huge flat-topped feature, nicknamed _Monte Cassino_ by the security forces, after one of the fiercest, most gruelling World War-II battles for the impregnable German-held natural defensive position and monastery in Italy and involving troops from twenty allied countries, including South Africa.
It was obvious that _Monte Cassino_ would have to be taken in order to occupy the New Chimoio.
The SAS and MNR had been bang in the middle of the enormous New Chimoio, surrounded by thousands of hostile enemy. The new path they had come across had been gouged into the bush by hundreds of enemy feet.
After Rich Stannard had called in the jets, the camp had moved west across tl~e Tete-Chimoio road and thus nearer to Rhodesia. It .was now only about twenty kilometres (12 miles) from the border.
The Rhodesians were worried that after the two security force compromises, the camp would be moved. But ZANLA had moved in so much equipment and got themselves so well dug in, it was virtually impossible for them to resite the camp.
Instead, ZANLA decided to stay and fight it out. According to captures, they had indeed been alerted by the aerial reconnaissance, and extra ammunition was brought in.
A major external operation codenamed _Miracle_ was subsequently launched against the New Chimoio under the command of Captain Richard Pomford, of the Selous Scouts.
The feeling in the Rhodesian camp was, if the biggest ZANLA complex in Mozambique could be smashed, it would serve to weaken Mugabe’s bargaining position in the Lancaster House conference in London.
The operation followed hard on the heels of _Uric_ where one of the lessons learned was that the security forces needed a properly constituted battle group consisting of mobile infantry, armoured cars and artillery.
Not wanting to repeat the mistakes of _Uric_, Captain Pomford’s forces consisted of such a group. His vehicles were armed with 14,5 millimetre and 12,7 millimetre heavy machineguns and he was supported by a squadron of armoured cars and a battery of 25 pounders belonging to the artillery. The operation was also supported by maximum air support.
The battle lasted two days and progress against this extremely well-sited enemy defensive position was slow.
In the past, the early base camp attacks had almost been a cakewalk. Now the Rhodesians were up against conventionally sited battalion positions whose resistance was determined. And unlike the normal enemy they had encountered over the years, who ran away, these ZANLA were prepared to hold their ground.
The enemy machinegun and mortar fire was well controlled and accurate. By night, mutually supporting heavy machineguns would fire tracers at a target, and where the tracer arcs met, they would then mortar that target. This made matters most unpleasant for Captain Pomford and his men.
When _Monte Cassino_ was eventually taken, a grand total of 11 enemy bodies were located and minimal amount of enemy equipment recovered. Valuable documents were recovered, as were John and Janet, the two tame baboons.
Assuming the enemy had carried their dead away with them, the results were still far from spectacular.
The camp was an incredible 64 kilometres (forty miles) square, far larger than they had been led to believe from the aerial pictures. It had housed 12 000, although a few thousand only had been there at the time the attack went in. There were so many people there that they had burned fully-grown trees, not merely logs, for their cooking fires.
Shoes and clothes lay in heaps as the wearers ran out of them in their haste to escape. Plates of mealie-meal porridge lay scattered in their trenches.
When a bomb run was put in on the camp, the elusive Rex Nhongo and his driver jumped into Nhongo’s green Landcruiser and bolted. The driver panicked and crashed into a tree, whereupon the occupants leapt out and ran away. ZANLA commander Josiah Tungamirai, seen hiding in his vehicle under the trees, also managed to get away with his life.
RLI stop groups were able to account for an untold number of retreating ZANLA.
An extremely sophisticated and vast trench system had been established in all of the three camps in New Chimoio. Even on the top of _Monte Cassino_, bunkers had been built into rocky ground and camouflaged by aloes.
The only Mozambican army involvement came in the night when six T34 tanks clanked towards the camp to bombard the troops on _Monte Cassino_. But they were beaten back by artillery fire from the Rhodesians’ rear base inside Mozambique. They returned next day, but by then the security forces had gone home.
In terms of costs, the air weaponry expended alone made such attacks a very expensive business.
The Rhodesians had now reached the situation where large groups of men, supported by air and support weapons, would capture a feature in host country territory, only to be forced to give it up almost immediately it had been won.
The casualty rate - several men had been lost - together with the expenditure in ammunition, was, from the planning viewpoint, making this type of operation non-cost-effective.
Camp attacks were no longer a cakewalk.
