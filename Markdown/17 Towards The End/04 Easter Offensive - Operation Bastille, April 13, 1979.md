The days of white rule were now drawing to a close and Rhodesia was gearing itself up for the first one-man-one-vote elections. After almost eighty years of white rule, power was about to be transferred to the blacks.
After the historic March 3 (1978) agreement between Ian Smith and the three internal moderate black leaders, there had been a period of transition, during which black and white cabinet ministers had worked together to guide the country towards black majority rule.
The elections, originally planned for December, 1978, had been postponed to the following April. Although three-quarters of the country was already under martial law, it had been impossible in the limited time frame to mobilise all Rhodesia’s available manpower which was needed to protect voters at the polling booths.
Yet despite overtures to the external leaders, they still refused to have anything to do with the whole arrangement and had condemned it from the outset. They branded the three internal black leaders puppets and traitors - and ZANLA had included them on a special Christmas “death list”.
Both ZANLA and ZIPRA pledged to intensify the armed struggle, and the internal settlement, far from bringing a ceasefire, increased the tempo of the war with a death rate of thirty-a-day.
By early 1979, the infrastructure of the tribal trust lands was in tatters. Insurgent activity had led to the closure of 900 schools together with mission hospitals, clinics and administrative centres in the rural areas. In many areas, there was virtually a total or partial breakdown of law and order.
The white farming lands and other areas where vital assets were situated were threatened and a number of important mining operations were closed down or forced to curtail production.
The economy which was also suffering from the effects of sanctions, was being attacked at strategic points. To the south, the rail lines were subjected to constant harassment, and the convoy system operated on all but a few major roads.
On the military front, the thin line of operational troops was stretched to its limits. Operational intelligence could not always be reacted to because of a lack of a sufficiently large mobile reserve of troops and helicopters, and at the same time there were increasing demands to act against bases in Mozambique and Zambia.
Rhodesian security forces were continually frustrated by the enemy’s ability to rebuild its forces and make good their losses.
The whites’ morale had plummeted to a new low when Joshua Nkomo’s ZIPRA shot down an Air Rhodesia Viscount full of holiday-makers... slaughtered ten of the survivors ... then five months later downed another plane killing everyone on board.
The country’s tourism slogan had been: “Rhodesia is Super.” As one South African newspaper headline commented: “’Rhodesia is not so super now”.
To the west a Danish airline was ferrying ZIPRA recruits from Botswana to Zambia for terror training. Some 2 670 men had been airlifted to Zambia before the Rhodesians let it be known via diplomatic channels that they were also prepared to shoot the plane down if the charter flights continued. The airlifts ceased immediately.
The blacks too continued to suffer at the hands of their fellow blacks. As always, the soft underbelly of society - the young, the pregnant, the defenceless - made excellent targets. Death came in many forms for Rhodesia’s suffering civilians: an axe in the back, a bullet, torture ...
As one commentator noted: “As so often happens in a guerilla war. civilians were the first and final losers.”
Then an urban terror group dealt the Rhodesian economy a severe blow by destroying the Salisbury fuel depot containing a quarter of the country’s fuel resources. Of the 28 storage tanks, 22 were completely destroyed and lan Smith called it a “great disaster”.
White emigration was rising and more than 13 500 people left the country in 1978, an increase of more than 3 000 on the previous year. But they were the official figures. Not reflected were the people who left ostensibly on holiday and never came back.
For what had started as “the chicken run” was now being called the “owl run” - a route taken by the wise.
Pressure was mounting from all sides and Rhodesians had their backs to the wall.
Now, just as black majority rule was about to become a reality, the Patriotic Front - the so-called alliance between ZANLA and ZIPRA, which was no more than a marriage of convenience maintained largely for the benefit of the OAU and various aid sponsors - threatened to disrupt the elections by force.
Then, an interesting item of intelligence came the Rhodesians’ way.
It had been known for some time that ZIPRA hierarchy travelled on the Grove Road in Botswana. en route to and from their Francistown offices, and in midMarch, the Selous Scouts ambushed a ZIPRA Land-Rover and car on a lonely stretch of the road leading to the Kazangula ferry.
They had hoped to waylay top ZIPRA man, Dumiso Dabengwa, Nkomo’s second-in-command, as well as Elliot Sibanda - the senior intelligence officer for all ZIPRA’s intelligence and security operations from Botswana - who were travelling north to Lusaka.
While they failed to get Dabengwa, their ambush had not been in vain. They managed to capture Elliot Sibanda - codenamed _The Black Swine_ - who was to prove the most important prisoner of the war. As a result of the wealth of information he gave the intelligence people, several very sophisticated operations were mounted.
The Scouts’ claymore went off behind the vehicle, and, thinking the petrol tank had exploded. Sibanda stopped the car, put on the handbrake and stepped out. It was only when he saw the black smoke hanging in the air that he realised what had happened, and fled. He ran straight into a stop group and was injured.
Soon a Special Branch officer had arrived to whisk him back across the border for immediate surgery to save his life.
“Hello, _Black Swine_.” the SB man said casually when he saw the injured terrorist. _The Black Swine_ was flabbergasted that the Rhodesian knew his name: but the Rhodesians had been monitoring his activities for years and there wasn’t much they didn’t know about the top ZIPRA man.
On the plane to Matabeleland, the injured prisoner promised SB that if they sorted him out he would “see what the story was”. And when he came around from his anaesthetic, he kept his word and was only too willing to talk. It was an unbelievable tale he had to tell, too.
Former SAS intelligence officer Captain Scotty McCormack, a member of the national intelligence team, was sent for and when he heard what _The Black Swine_ had to say, he headed for Salisbury and hurried straight to ComOps.
He was eventually ushered into Ian Smith’s office to give him a briefing.
“Very interesting, young man.” the Prime Minister said to Scotty when he had finished. “thank you very much indeed. Good afternoon.”
What Elliot Sibanda had to say, was indeed riveting. A specially-convened meeting was held at ComOps and SB officers were called from Bulawayo to give a briefing. So improbable was the prisoner’s story that they were hard put to convince their superiors that Sibanda was telling the truth, and they left the meeting certain no one believed them.
For what Nkomo was planning was a whole new ball game in the war that had ground on in much the same way year in, year out, and which had followed the normal revolutionary doctrine to the letter.
Unlike Robert Mugabe. who had always sent droves of men into the country, Joshua Nkomo, who had a different strategy altogether, had been holding back most of his men in their Zambian camps, committing a small fraction, a mere couple of thousand guerillas, to Rhodesia. It had become a sore point with ZANLA cadres, so much so that they bitterly referred to ZIPRA as the _matshowashowe_ (shuffling walkers) because of their slow prosecution of the war.
The Rhodesians too had largely concentrated their attention on ZANLA, for that was where the main threat lay, ZIPRA, the feeling went, could be sorted out once they had dealt with ZANLA.
But Nkomo, lavishly supported by the Soviets, who eyed Rhodesia with its natural resources as a glittering African jewel, had now emerged as a key factor in the military equation and was all set to enter a new phase in the war.
Acting on the Russians’ advice, Nkomo planned to adopt a more positive and meaningful approach to all their operations. Not only that, but he was going to pour thousands of conventionally trained troops - regulars, trained in classical warfare, as opposed to guerillas - into Rhodesia.
They were poised to mount a full-scale invasion.
The idea was to send his guerillas in first, sabotaging and preparing the way for the conventional forces. They planned to have two bridgeheads across the Zambezi, one at Victoria Falls, the other at Kariba/Chirundu. If they were unable to use the bridges that were already there, or in the event of their being destroyed, they would make use of their own pontoons.
Then, conventionally trained infantry in armoured vehicles would drive into Rhodesia, taking over the airports at Victoria Falls, Wankie, Kariba and later at Salisbury. Once in control at Wankie and Kariba airports, they planned to fly in other conventional troops in Libyan transport planes.
In terms of international recognition, if they could say they controlled an area which they undoubtedly would if they had the airfields - they would be recognised as a government
It was to be a lightning attack and for the plan to succeed, Salisbury would have to be taken within 24 hours. Columns of armoured vehicles together with foot soldiers were to be used to capture the capital.
Rhodesian security forces were to be eliminated in their push through the country. ZIPRA also planned to crush ZANLA who were pushing across Rhodesia into Nkomo’s western stronghold of Matabeleland. Mugabe’s men had crossed the Plumtree rail line and definitely had the upper hand.
The Russians, who had been taking a much more active interest in ZIPRA’s operational activities, including the Soviet Ambassador to Zambia, Vassily Solodovnikov, a senior KGB official, had assigned a 12-man Soviet advisory team to ZIPRA, headed by Colonel Vladimir Buchiyev, a KGB military specialist.
The SAS were subsequently tasked to eliminate the Russian advisers, but the plan never came to fruition. They knew exactly where they lived and planned to drive to the house in a captured ZIPRA Land-Rover and park under the trees. Then they were simply going to ring the doorbell, storm the building and kill everyone inside. In the end, the CIO put a stop to the plan as the Russians could always have denied the victims were military advisers. Such an incident too would be guaranteed to spark off an international uproar.
The Soviets had reorganised ZIPRA’s operational boundaries and made other changes but they were appalled at the way ZIPRA had been conducting the war.
Finally, a conference of the ZIPRA War Council was convened and all the front commanders were recalled from the field.
“Here is a map. You _must_ know the disposition of your own forces - who you’ve got where, what sectors they control, what their targets are - and everything about the enemy,” an adviser briefed them.
Makepesi Tshuma, the northern front region commander, was called forward to give a briefing.
“How many troops have you got?”
“I don’t know,” he replied.
“Show us on the map where they all are.”
“I don’t know.”
“What area are you controlling?”
“I don’t know.”
“How many enemy are in your area of operation?”
“I don’t know.”
“Which are your temporary and permanent camps?”
“I don’t know,” said the deflated ZIPRA commander.
The Russians were seething. It was all quite useless: ZIPRA could never expect to achieve anything, they said.
ZIPRA commanders then spent the next three weeks learning how to plot ZIPRA deployments and security force dispositions on to maps.
Their lessons over, the entire ZIPRA high command was assembled for a meeting at which the Soviets did most of the talking, emphasising that maps had to be kept showing dispositions and targets, that reconnaissance missions were vital to operations, that security forces had to be attacked in their home bases and not merely in the bush.
The Soviets stressed that they should rely on surprise attacks rather than meeting the security forces face-to-face as they did not have enough experience to take the Rhodesians on in direct combat
They emphasised that ZIPRA should not fight white civilians and were angry about those killings, particularly of white farmers who were growing food which might be of use to ZIPRA. White skin was not the criteria, they argued. The war was against a system of government
They disagreed with ZIPRA Army Commander Lameck Mafella, who said ZIPRA should fight ZANLA. The Soviets’ idea was that the two nationalist forces should unite, and once big enough they could free the country in six months.
Russian advisers said that ZIPRA had to change tactics in favour of much larger forces. In short, they had to get on to a more conventional footing.
The most successful idea would be a mechanised infantry role where they had infantry-fighting vehicles with foot soldiers in between. Then. they could invade...
Nkomo, very much in the Russian camp, did as he was bid. Acting in liaison with the OAU and the Zambian authorities, conventional training began at Mulungushi and in Boma Camp in Angola, where the mechanised infantry role with soldiers strung out in between the vehicles was practised ad nauseum.
As part of his master plan to rule Rhodesia, civilian pilots were under training in Ethiopia. Police, customs and immigration officers were being trained by the Zambians. Nkomo - and the Russians - wanted people capable of running Rhodesia when he took over.
And he certainly had the manpower for his “government-in-exile” ... from schoolchildren, right up to university graduates, both volunteers to his cause and people abducted from Rhodesia over the years. In their drive for recruits, ZIPRA had succeeded in destroying the school system in Matabeleland.
The military statistics were indeed alarming. The Rhodesians knew that Nkomo planned to infiltrate 9 000 ZIPRA to occupy Victoria Falls, Pandametenga and Plumtree. Of ZIPRA’s 20 000 trained men biding their time in Zambia, 4 000 were conventionally trained.
Although only 2 500 men were operating in Matabeleland by Easter, 1979, eight ZIPRA battalions had been regrouped at Mulungushi training camp in Zambia while a ninth - a motorised battalion - equipped with SAM-7 missiles and 14.5 A/A guns was said to be held in Livingstone in readiness to storm Victoria Falls bridge.
The feeling in some Rhodesian military circles was that ZIPRA would initially use three forces to invade. One would cross the Zambezi both up and downstream. Another would secure Victoria Falls airfield and its confines. One would block the roads both in and out of the village, while another would move in and secure the bridge. Then, thousands of reinforcements would cross the bridge.
Nkomo had boasted to the world that he would occupy Salisbury by May, 1979, and had stated that all units of ZIPRA had been ordered to paralyse the enemy with attacks on military, economic and strategic installations.
ZIPRA supporters in the Lupane region of Matabeleland had been told to prepare for a campaign of civil disobedience to coincide with the infiltration of the ZIPRA army.
Now, on the eve of black majority rule and after more than twenty long years in black nationalist politics, Nkomo, the Kenyatta-like demagogue, the father figure of Zimbabwe nationalism, was about to make his move and take Rhodesia by force.
Security force troops were immediately deployed along the border in strength to monitor crossing points and defend the country. But it was imperative that the threat be pre-empted and the guerilla tide turned. The answer was obvious.
They would have to strike at the very heart of the ZIPRA terror organisation. Nkomo would have to be _taken out…_ assassinated.
The Rhodesians’ intelligence was excellent and SB had gained further information on the lay-out and security arrangements at Nkomo’s house in the Zambian capital from a capture who had lunched with the ZIPRA leader in January. He had been there when a British diplomat had carried a message from Rhodesian politicians that they wanted to talk to Nkomo again.
Undercover Selous Scouts had infiltrated Zambia several months before and reccied Nkomo’s house - the former residence of President Kenneth Kaunda - a sprawling light-green bungalow in a well-to-do suburb in the heart of Lusaka. Following the downing of the first Viscount, the Scouts bad been tasked to eliminate Nkomo and several daring clandestine and overt attempts on his life had been made.
Nkomo however, proved an elusive target and spent more time away than at home. Many ingenious plans were hatched by the Scouts, but they were beset with difficulties and downright bad luck and further thwarted by Nkomo’s irregular comings and goings. The operation - codenamed _Aspect_ - was first on ... then off… then on again.
The operation dragged on for several months - and then came disaster. The Selous Scouts undercover agent, Mike Broadman, was arrested and thrown in gaol just as he was about to leave the country.
It had happened just as the all-important one-man-one-vote elections were to be held and some 60 000 men called up to provide a solid web of defence to protect the voters as they went to the polling booths.
It was imperative ZIPRA’s invasion plans be halted before then: crucial Nkomo be assassinated as quickly as possible.
While an intense air strike programme was carried out against ZIPRA targets, including the conventional training camp at Mulungushi, 100 kilometres (62 miles) north-east of Lusaka, Nkomo still lived. Then the SAS was called in, told what had been tried to date and tasked to prepare a parallel plan in the event of the SAS getting the job.
Their contingency planning started almost immediately and the Squadron Second-In-Command Major Dave Dodson, and Captain Martin Pearse, commander of “C” Squadron, got together to dust off several ideas.
Martin Pearse, renowned and respected in the SAS for his meticulous planning, did a lot of good work and spent many long hours at home, including an all-night session, poring over the plan, considering and weighing up the pros and cons before arriving at a feasible proposition.
The two men worked on a full military appreciation of the task - methods of entry ... the likely enemy they might meet ... the methods of exfiltration ... the risks involved ... And there were certainly plenty of those.
The Zambian Army just two kilometres away from Nkomo’s house at Arakan Barracks ... the resident armed guards at President Kaunda’s house a stone’s throw from the target. Then there were the police ... the air force ... the new beefed-up British-supplied air capabilities.., the 150 tons of equipment and Rapier missiles...
the locals.., the dozen or so ZIPRA guards at Nkomo’s house... Nkomo. too, was known to carry a pistol.
The un known factor was the Zambian reaction to a ground strike in the heart of the capital, and with this in mind. the two men realised they would have to be flexible, have a lot of firepower, and be completely mobile themselves without having to seize anything from the Zambians.
There was only one logical course of action - they would have to drive to Lusaka in their _own_ transport, and do so at night. Their plan hinged on a fleet of vehicles… a ferry… and a few tins of paint. Plus a lot of bravado.
The two officers decided the best plan would be to use Sabre Land-Rovers, the SAS’s redundant pre-bush war specialist vehicle, to give them a dark-green colour scheme with yellow paint splodges, making them similar to the Zambian security force vehicles.
The Zambians did not in fact have vehicles of that same configuration, but the two men were gambling that. with the paint job, and the fact that the front of the first and the back of the last vehicles in their convoy would have Zambian number plates none of the others would have plates - they would get away with the scheme.
They would wear their own Rhodesian Army combat camouflage uniforms, their normal NATO pattern helmets and _Black-Is-Beautiful_ masks.
A large double-storey commercial ferry, _The Sea Lion_, was to take them and their vehicles to the northern shores, putting them down as soon after last light as possible. They would then follow a rough track… then a dirt road west of Siavonga to the main Kafue-Lusaka road.
Thereafter, the convoy would drive into Lusaka... assassinate Nkomo - then drive all the way back to the lakeshore again.
The biggest worry facing the SAS was what awaited them at the Kafue River bridge.
They knew it was guarded, and sketches drawn by Selous Scouts undercover agents had shown a heavy army presence, with four 14,5 millimetre anti-aircraft weapons in position 300 metres on the south side of the bridge. The agent had seen a 12,7 millimetre gun there, too, but the latest reports were that it had been moved.
If they had to fight it out. it would depend on the extent of their casualties as to whether they aborted the mission or not. And if they continued to the target regardless, would the Zambian Army be waiting for them in Lusaka?
Even if they got to the capital undetected and pulled offthe job, what of their return journey’? Surely the Zambians would try and cut them off at Kafue bridge? The two men had come up with an ambitious yet brilliant plan. It would be Rhodesia’s own Entebbe. And it would have to be carried out with the same sort of panache as the Israeli’s displayed on their most famous strike.
They knew it was well within the SAS capabilities: but would the ComOps people approve the scheme, when other less-audacious suggestions for missions had been turned down in the past’?
When some of the national planners heard of it they were totally against the scheme. They felt it was an extremely high-risk operation. The Kafue bridge was guarded and they felt the Rhodesians would never get across it. They felt, too, that the intelligence on Nkomo’s movements was not good enough to mount such a massive mission so far from home.
Nevertheless, the plan was accepted and the operation - codenamed _Bastille_ - given the go-ahead to the utter surprise of Major Dave Dodson and Captain Martin Pearse, who were unused to a favourable response to SAS-inspired suggestions.
When it became apparent that the _Sea Lion_ would take 42 men, and the attack on Nkomo’s house could be done with only 16 operators, the SAS asked that they be given other targets to inflict as much damage as possible on one operation while the political climate was favourable ... to spread confusion ... and thus stretch any Zambian reaction force.
They also hoped that by taking extra men they would be able to provide a reserve element if their original escape route was blocked.
The additional troops would be able to help out in the event of a breakdown and would be able to step in should they take heavy casualties either on the infiltration, the attack or exfiltration phase.
The SAS suggested to the hierarchy that a possible target might be the Lusaka prison where the Selous Scout agent. Mike Broadman. was incarcerated. But permission was refused although the SAS could never really understand the reason why.
The commander of the Selous Scouts. Lieutenant-Colonel Ron Reid-Daly. had also sought approval for a similar plan and had met the same response.
The SAS were, however, to get their extra men and two other targets - ZIPRA’s main armoury to the west of Lusaka. which they shared with the Zambian army. and ‘Liberation Centre,’ a guarded prefabricated building that housed many of the ZIPRA hierarchy as well as SWAPO and ANC insurgents. Rhodesian intelligence agencies knew of the existence of both targets, but the prisoner. _The Black Swine_ had been able to confirm the exact locations.
Everything had to be worked out in the finest detail, the least of which was ensuring their ten-year-old vehicles were serviceable. The Sabres had seen their fair share of action in the rugged terrain of the Zambezi Valley, but since the introduction of mine warfare, they had been placed virtually in mothballs. Eventually, the fleet was ready for the 200 kilometre (124 mile) trip to Lusaka.
Security was extremely tight, and as it was necessary to carry out most of the preparation for the op in Kabrit. Dave Dodson initially only briefed the vehicle commanders.
When he told them of the plan, one incredulous sergeant stood up to enquire: “Are you fuckin’ mad?”
That, they joked afterwards, was precisely what one kamikazi pilot asked after _his_ briefing.
As Dodson recalled: “There was general hilarity and quite a bit of excitement. Disbelief, too.”
A couple of days’ rehearsals got underway at Kabrit Barracks with the drivers practising four-wheel drive in preparation for the rugged trip on the dirt road north.
Then the seven vehicles and 42 men made their way to Lake Kariba, with the drivers fully testing their vehicles on the way. As most men still didn’t know the exact nature of the mission, there was much speculation, with some thinking they were going to Zambia to make a snatch - to take a prisoner.
They stopped off at Karoi for a drink and a snack and the convoy caught the attention of a couple of men at the nearby police camp.
“Hey. where you guys going?” one asked casually.
“Oh, We’re off to Lusaka.” quipped an uninformed trooper with a laugh… and it was only when the convoy got to Kariba that the SAS were called into the ops tent, told not to speculate any more - and that they were indeed going to Lusaka.
The ops tent was not big enough for everyone to fit in and as one group filed in after the other to be briefed, the faces of the men coming out were a picture.
There was a distinct feeling of excitement in the air and most men were speechless. “What could you say? It was brilliant. It was the op of a lifetime and we were going on it,” said one.
One man managed to get hold of a “Rhodesia Is Super” postcard, which he phmned to leave at the house of  _The Fat Man_ as Nkomo became known to the SAS.
To maintain security, they kept well away from Kariba village itself and were based up at Wafa Wafa, the Selous Scouts training camp, and staying well away from other troops.
After the outline briefing, they split into their groups for their detailed orders.
Martin Pearse was to lead the main strike force to Nkomo’s house - the priority target which was screened from view by a high-wire security fence covered with green hessian, with grass and vegetation woven into it. Major Dave Dodson, who was to be in overall command of the operation was to go to Nkomo’s house with them.
They studied photographs taken by the Selous Scouts agent and a British film of Nkomo outside his home… went over and over which routes they would take to get to the house… where they would split up... who would go where… what they would do and when ... and the rendezvous procedures afterwards.
Lieutenant Mac McIntosh was to take another group to attack the armoury on the west of Lusaka - while Lieutenant Rich Stannard and his team were to flatten Liberation Centre a few kilometres away from the main target.
The Sabres were painted green ... mortar cases were packed full of plastic explosives to make demolition charges… and the three teams ran through their procedures until they got them down to a fine art. And while all this frenzied activity was going on Sergeant Willum Butler found a deserted landing close to Siavonga where the thirty metre (100 feet) _Sea Lion_ ferry could beach unnoticed, finding a place shallow enough to allow the ferry to land right on the shore, yet not too shallow to preclude them from getting their vehicles straight on to dry land.
With him was RSM Pete Allan, who was to command a six-man beach party, which would secure the area, set up mortars, and support the beach landing by providing protection just before the ferry docked.
The party was to remain on the beach until the rest of the operators returned from Lusaka ensuring the ferry could dock again in safety and the raiders had a secure place from where they could cross back into Rhodesia. They would be missing out on the action, but they took comfort in the fact that their role was crucial to the success of the mission.
The commander then prepared report lines, code names for various landmarks on the way to Lusaka and for each particular phase of the operation. Thus when they reached a specific place and completed a task, he would simply radio the prearranged code word telling the ComOps planners and intelligence chiefs where they were. and if they were sticking to their original time appreciation.
Apart from being quicker, this would also be indecipherable to anyone monitoring their signals that night
He named many of the places after characters in a television series, _The Muppet Show_, ComOps was known to the SAS as the _Muppet Show_, largely, as the SAS explained, because of their lack of positive thinking. (ComOps was not amused and would eventually order the SAS to stop calling them the _Muppet Show_.)
Two other soldiers with a sense of humour were Lieutenant Rich Stannard and his callsign second-in-command Sergeant Billy Gardner. Rich had planned his fun back in Salisbury and taken along a little yellow duck in his kit.
He painted it green and drilled it in place on his Sabre. He didn’t want it to be _too_ conspicuous on the long journey north, after all.
Influenced by a recently released citizen’s band trucking film entitled _Convoy_. Rich chose Rubber Duck for his “handle”.
Then the two friends painted a pink pig on the side of Billy Gardner’s Sabre. They were now set for their citizen’s band trucking trip on the long night-time haul to Lusaka.
An ex-British SAS man who had worked in Zambia for some time and knew his way around the capital was to travel to Lusaka with them to act as a guide.
Eventually, the strike force was ready. All they needed now was the word. An externally-based CIO agent was to let them know when Joshua Nkomo was at home in Lusaka.
There were problems getting the vehicles on to the ferry, but eventually all seven made it. Now the freshly-painted Sabres were daubed with yellow paint splodges to add to the charade that they were Zambian army vehicles.
Everyone was tense as they headed for Zambia that night. But they got halfway across the lake. and were recalled to Rhodesia. No, their radio told them, the mission was not tonight. A sense of anti-climax swept over them just as it always did when they were keyed up to the limit ... and then had to relax to await another day.
Returning to Wafa Wafa, the commander was told that they bad to take two Selous Scouts on the mission, and one, Captain Ant White. who had been involved in the Scouts’ plan to eliminate Nkomo in Lusaka, was to act as their guide.
“This immediately rubbed everyone up the wrong way… and we tried to get rid of them. Not because they were Selous Scouts, but we objected very strongly to the General dictating to us exactly who we would take on the raid, which was most unusual … It was not well received, especially as a couple of blokes had to get off to make room for them,” Dodson recalled.
What further rattled the SAS was that they already had a guide, the ex-British SAS man. But as the Selous Scouts had done a lot of the work, ComOps felt that they deserved to be in on the final act… and Ant White and a black Scout were to go along.
The black Scout was to be dressed in a Zambian army captain’s uniform and his role was to do the talking at Kafue bridge or wherever they got into difficulties.
At 11h00 on April 12 - five days before the elections were to begin - the strike force and their camouflaged vehicles were back on the Sea Lion again, waiting for the word to come.
Some put their sleeping bags down on the top deck and had a nap under the morning sun. Would it be another case of greatcoats on, greatcoats off, they mused?
Secretly they thought that this time would be the real thing Now, they were much more relaxed than the previous days’ wait. They were with an experienced crew. They had the benefit of a perfect plan. Everyone knew what to do: knew what the alternatives were.
Then came the green light. The Rhodesian external agent had seen Nkomo go into his home and the all go was flashed to “C” Squadron waiting patiently out on the lake.
“Bastille Go.” the signal read. “Have fun!”
At last! Everyone was relieved that the op was on: excited at the prospect of what lay ahead. They were within hours of driving through the streets of the Zambian capital under the full glare of the city lights. And while Rhodesians slept soundly in their beds, one of the country’s two public enemies was going to be blasted to kingdom come in the heart of his friendly host nation.
There was still a bit of daylight left as _Sea Lion_ approached Zambian waters and the commander decided to vary his original timings and risk landing as soon as possible rather than wait until just after last light.
His plan went without a hitch. _Sea Lion_ nosed into the shore and the protection party under the command of RSM Pete Allan went ahead to set up their mortars and to secure the beachhead.
There was no one around to oppose them and once the mortars were in position, the 42 troops, who were to travel to Lusaka in their seven Sabre vehicles, drove off the ferry, with the commander leading the way.
The ferry moved back on to the lake to avoid discovery and to await the word for the pick-up.
So far, so good. It was just after 18h00. They were ahead of schedule, and as the attack on Nkomo’s house was due to go in at 02h00, there was plenty of time to get to Lusaka.
They were a long way from anywhere and were not anticipating any Zambian resistance. The only thing worrying the commander at this stage was an unmarked landmine planted somewhere in the area by Rhodesian security forces.
Most men were apprehensive but silently acknowledged they were so well-armed that they would be able to deal with most problems with the possible exception of Kafue bridge.
They set off immediately. Their vehicle lights were on and the moon was shining brightly, and that helped them considerably on the dirt track.
Thirty minutes later they sent their first progress report to ComOps via the command Dakota flying somewhere over Zambia that night and carrying the SAS CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett. As the ComOps teleprinter clattered into life and punched out the report line, _Horny Prawn_, the military planners and intelligence chiefs back in Salisbury knew that the operators were well and truly on their way.
The dirt track was far better than the commander had expected and for the first ten kilometres, they made good time. But then the road began to deteriorate, and although Dodson had anticipated that from his aerial reconnaissance, they became disorientated.
They drove into the middle of a village and the black Selous Scout who spoke the local dialect asked the way from the locals, whose first reaction was to whip out their ZAPU membership cards, thinking their unexpected visitors were ZIPRA.
The Rhodesians put them right and the translation that came back was “Oh My God! There’s going to be trouble.”
But the SAS only wanted directions and the villagers were only too pleased to point the way to Lusaka. The villagers were not considered a risk and as they were unlikely to raise the alarm, they were released unharmed.
The commander was grateful for their help, and the convoy was soon on its way again, having lost about twenty minutes.
Rich Stannard thought it was about time he tried out his citizen’s band trucking technique. Abandoning his _Rubber Duck_ “handle” for the time being, he called up his callsign second-in-command, Sergeant Billy Gardner travelling in the Sabre behind.
“_Suicide Jockey_ to _Pink Pig_. _Suicide Jockey_ to _Pink Pig_. Do you read me? Over.”
From the vehicle behind, came: “_Pink Pig_ to _Suicide Jockey_. ”
But the commander had heard all and promptly ordered them to cut it out before their transmission could get into full swing.
At 19h40, Siavonga police messages intercepted in Salisbury reported that the _Sea Lion_ had been seen violating Zambian waters. They assumed that the Rhodesians were on their way to attack a nearby army camp.
JOC _Splinter_ was immediately called in to help and troops were sent across the lake to Chipepo harbour to harass and attack a fishing camp, a decoy tactic to mislead the Zambians into thinking that was where the main attack was centred.
Meanwhile, the strike force was on its way north. But the track deteriorated further and at times it faded away completely. It was necessary to use a lot of four-wheel drive and fuel to cover the twenty kilometres (I 2 miles) to one of the main bus routes, which they knew by the codename _Swedish Chef_.
But the planning had been meticulous and Dave Dodson had anticipated most problems, and each vehicle carried three times the fuel needed.
By now the excitement had died down somewhat and there was very little talk. Everyone had settled down to a long hard slog on the poor trace. They bounced their vehicles through the mud and where the track was washed away, they felt more like sailors than soldiers, as they put their weight on one side to stop the listing vehicles sinking into the mud.
Then came another problem.
At 21h30, an urgent message was passed to the commander that one of the vehicles had broken down. The vehicle, commanded by Lieutenant Phil Brooke, had been driven through a puddle and had spluttered to a halt in the clearing in the bush, refusing to go any further.
They were already running quite late now because of the poor state of the track and it was just about the last thing the commander wanted to hear.
Several heads went under the bonnet. There was a bit of tinkering, but the ignition coil had been burned out and not having a mechanic with them, nothing could be done to solve the problem.
There was only one answer. The vehicle would have to be left behind as would the driver and passengers, who were to have gone with Mac McIntosh and his crew to the ZIPRA armoury. They would be picked up when the others returned from the mission, in the meantime, they were to rig up the vehicle for demolition.
When Dodson reluctantly broke the news to Phil Brooke and his men, they were just about ready to cut his throat.
They asked if they could travel on the other vehicles but the commander ruled there was just no room. He couldn’t risk overloading the Sabres with any further passengers only to have them break down, too.
The bitter disappointment felt by Phil Brooke and his team at that moment can only be imagined. First, they had the excitement of having been lucky enough to get on the mission, an opportunity the men of “A” and “B” Squadrons would have given their eye-teeth for. Then there was the utter frustration of getting this close only to miss out on what had to be one of the greatest adventures of the war.
It was a grim little group indeed which watched and cursed as the remaining six vehicles moved off into the gloom of the night again.
By the time they hit _Swedish Chef_ - the main dirt bus route - it was 22h05 and they were already ninety minutes behind schedule.
Would they manage to stick to their timings and attack the targets by 02h00, allowing them plenty of leeway to get out of town under cover of darkness? And what of the armoury target now that they were six men short?
Just to add to their worries, the commander was told over his radio that there was now thought to be a Zambian Army presence on their infiltration route.
They were relieved to find the dirt bus route in good order. The going now was easy and they sped along calling off the various codewords, arriving within 200 metres of _Fozzie Bear_ - the main tar road - at 00h46.
They were still running late but afforded themselves a brief stop to stretch their legs and have a smoke, while they refuelled and checked their weapons. They discussed whether or not they should call off the mission that night and try again the following night. But in the end, the commander decided he was quite happy to carry on and risk being caught in Lusaka at first light.
A couple of vehicles rolled past them in the early morning, and the soldiers thought it a bit strange. It was very different from Rhodesia where there was very little nighttime traffic in the farming areas because of the fear of ambushes.
The SAS waved the late-night travellers on, and they went on their way unsuspecting,
All too soon it was time to go and give Lusaka a rude awakening, Stuart Batters had been driving the command vehicle and had done a magnificent job of driving through the hills, making Dodson prematurely greyer in the process, but getting them there as quickly as possible.
They now changed drivers and the ex-British 22 SAS guide took over the wheel. But within fifty metres the driver inadvertently jammed his rifle in the steering wheel and the vehicle veered up the verge and overturned, throwing the passengers and equipment out and bringing the column of vehicles to a grinding halt.
Fortunately, there were no serious injuries, but it had been a close shave. Their main radio was however, damaged, although they didn’t realise it at the time.
They were soon on their way again, and now had a few more minutes to make up.
Although there were a couple of other worrying moments, nothing came of them. A luminous sign warned of _Police Ahead_, but it was only a traffic accident and there wasn’t a policeman to be seen. As they approached the Chirundu-Kafue turnoff and the main Lusaka road, their hearts were in their mouths when they saw a Zambian Army vehicle outside a beerhall. But again, there was no one to give them trouble and it was obvious the Zambian soldiers were inside having a fine old time.
Then came the biggest worry of all - the Kafue river bridge.
If there was going to be a compromise it would happen here. They were well blackened-up, but as every man knew, they would not fool anyone on close inspection.
When the bridge came into view, the commander could see that it was exactly as their photographs has shown - very long and very imposing. The troops were a bit taken aback by its sheer size and the mass of steel girders. They had imagined it to be a lot smaller.
Everyone braced himself for a punch-up. The machineguns were mounted now and the safety catches were off their rifles. Apprehension and danger were in the air and there was more than one sweaty palm.
Dodson gripped his silenced pistol and ordered his vehicle ahead. The others dropped back to two hundred metres so as not to illuminate the command Sabre with their lights, but were close enough to give fire support if necessary.
Then came the biggest surprise of the entire operation. There was nothing and no one to hinder their progress. No barricades, no weapons: not a single sentry.
Both Dave Dodson and Martin Pearse had not really believed the reports of their being vast numbers of enemy on the bridge, and they were proved correct. Nevertheless, it was a great relief to all.
The others followed Dodson over the Kafue bridge, hardly daring to believe their good luck. The last vehicle fell behind a bit, and Martin Pearse urged his driver Barry Skinner to catch up.
They now set course for Kafue town and Lusaka, slopping for a couple of minutes only to put Sergeant Mike Beal and his small callsign down two kilomelres from the bridge. They were to monitor the activities and see if the Zambians put up roadblocks to prevent the raiders returning home.
If something went wrong and the convoy had to lake another route, Mike Beal and his men were to walk out of the area and be picked up later. Within seconds, they had waved a farewell to Mike Beal and were on their way again, passing Kafue police station without incident
There was far more traffic than they had been expecting, and they deliberately kept their faces averted to avoid their features being recognised in the glare of the oncoming lights. Most operators were crowded into the back of the vehicles so as not to arouse any undue suspicion.
When a vehicle pulled up behind them, the operation suddenly look on the suspense of a Hitchcock thriller. Not wishing to shoot the passengers and alert the Zambian police training camp further on, Marlin Pearse stood up and waved the driver on.
The man obeyed the command and pulled out then hit the accelerator and disappeared without suspecting a thing. It was only afterwards when the SAS had time to analyse the events of that night, that they realised how incredible it was.
Twenty-five kilomelres out of Lusaka the convoy passed a little shanty town. Lights were on and there was a string of shacks. People were milling around, while inside a building, men were gathered around a pinball machine. Again, the SAS men marvelled at how busy Lusaka was at night.
The convoy drove on. There was not long to go now. Then, suddenly, they were there.
An orange glow ahead of them warned they were approaching the Zambian capital.
Some of the chaps look off their scarves and gloves for they knew that once the action began, they would be sweating and wouldn’t need them any more.
Then came the street lights of the Zambian capital. It was just like any other big city with its lights on. Traffic rolled on its way, and off in the distance, they could make out the blink of traffic lights.
Suddenly, the large “’Welcome to Lusaka” sign on the side of the road brought home the reality of the situation. Here they were in the heart of hostile Zambia, home to Joshua Nkomo ... not to mention the Zambian police, army and air force.
There was a smell of danger about the place and the tension in the six Sabres was unbearable. A couple of chaps who had been napping in the back of the vehicles were shaken awake.
The SAS were trying to look as nonchalant and as negroid as possible as the glare of civilian headlights threatened to expose their true identity.
Andrew Standish-White in the rear vehicle realised he had a rip in his camouflage uniform and was having to crouch lower than the others, fearful that his pink arm showing through the tear would give their game away even before it had begun.
At last, they turned right towards a roundabout leading to the city centre where a huge octagonal glass skyscraper dominated the Lusaka skyline. This was codenamed the _Muppet Show_ and was the final report line that had to be sent back to Salisbury.
A few soldiers looked at the skyscraper with a professional eye and couldn’t resist commenting in muted tones what a lovely target it would make. The scenario wasn’t difficult to envisage. A few well-placed grenades and the glass would be cascading down on the city in no time at all. Right at that moment though, there was far more important work to do. Perhaps they would get a crack at it later?
They were minutes away from shattering the very heart of the ZIPRA war machine - the assassination of Joshua Nkomo, father figure of Zimbabwe nationalism to countless thousands.
In view of the loss of Phil Brooke’s Sabre and the six troops, the commander now decided to abandon Mac McIntosh’s armoury task.
To send Mac’s vehicle to the armoury on its own was risky. The armoury was on the opposite side of Lusaka to the priority target, and without a back-up vehicle there could be problems. If the vehicle was waylaid, or seized up, the troops would be unable to get out of Lusaka.
While the six men on Mac’s vehicle could have coped with the target, they could hardly inflict the damage that the original 12 attackers could do. They had already discussed sending another callsign to help out at the armoury, but the operators in question were reluctant to undertake the mission without a full briefing.
Much to their disgust, Mac McIntosh and his five men were told they would have to go with the main party of men to Nkomo’s house, where they would go into a reserve role.
As the 36 Rhodesians drove into the heart of Lusaka, their watches showed 02h40.
They had managed to make up a bit of time but they had arrived a lot later than they had expected.
Lieutenant Rich Stannard, who was to lead a team to Liberation Centre, was towards the back of the convoy and turned off to his target.
The rest of the convoy continued on through the well-illuminated city streets, heading towards Brentwood Drive and _The Fat Man’s_ house.
They knew that behind the green hessian screen surrounding Nkomo’s rambling colonial bungalow, there would be guards on duty. There were between 15-20 weapon-wielding bodyguards in the house itself and more lived in a nearby white building: then there were two armed guards on the gates to check on callers’ bona tides.
It was eerie driving through the middle of Lusaka. “There we were, fairly well gunned up - two machineguns and an RPG-7 per vehicle, each gun having I 500 rounds in it, six or seven troops in the back. helmets on, blackened-up,” the commander recalled.
“The traffic lights were working, and so to keep the convoy together and delay any suspicions of the locals drifting around, we stopped at the lights. A bloke pulled up next to us and we half waved at him and he half waved at us.”
The SAS knew that only bluff could succeed in getting the party through. As the lights changed to green, the drivers slowly let out their clutches and then they were on their way to Nkomo’s house, again no one suspecting a thing.
A few kilometres away across the city, the two other SAS vehicles were en route to Liberation Centre, just five minutes’ ride from the huge roundabout, a journey which took them south past the railway line and a few little African stores.
At first, they drove straight past Liberation Centre, which was obscured from view by a high wall. Sergeant Major Bruce Langley spotted their error and they did a quick U-turn, travelling all the way around the building until they neared the main gate, carefully keeping out of sight of the sentries at the entrance.
Now they had to sit and wait until they heard the sounds of firing coming from _The Fat Man’s_ house - the signal for Rich Stannard to initiate the attack on Liberation Centre.
The main strike force, meanwhile, were closing on Nkomo’s house, having taken only one wrong turning. It was exactly as they had seen it on their film and still photographs. The yard was screened from the road by the hessian covering the high fence and grass was woven into the screen.
They stopped for thirty seconds while the commander gave his final orders. Every driver knew where he was to go, every operator knew what he had to do.
Marlin Pearse was to breach the 1.8 metre (six feet) security wall on President’s Lane, then after all opposition was silenced, he was to lead three other men into the house to assassinate Nkomo.
At the same time he was blasting an entrance on his side, Dave Dodson and his team in one vehicle and Sergeant Major _Petrol Paul_ in the other, were to breach the two main gates, then bunker bomb and rocket their side of the house, leaving the way clear for Martin Pearse to get on with the house-fighting.
Mac McIntosh and his team meanwhile would be in reserve, keeping their eyes peeled for outside interference.
Dodson gave the command, wished them well and three vehicles roared off at speed along the deserted streets, two in one direction, the remainder in the other.
It was now 02h55.
Martin Pearse’s vehicle came screeching up with the intention of stopping behind the house, thereby using it as protection from the commander’s arc of fire from Nyerere Road.
The plan had been for Martin to tap his driver on his helmet to stop. But a trigger happy guard behind the security fence had already opened up. The order never came and the driver overshot slightly. Some of the shots the vehicle collected may have come from the SAS commander’s Sabre on the opposite side of the target as a result.
Immediately the first guard opened up on them, Andrew Standish-White, manning the rear machinegun on Martin’s vehicle, stood up and initiated for the Rhodesians, letting rip at a cluster of security huts, and emptying his first belt in record time.
There was no time to be lost and Marlin Pearse leapt from his vehicle and raced to the fence to attach an explosive charge to blast an entrance to the grounds. The charge was made up in an ordinary normal garden hose and on the rush to the gate someone stood on the hook needed to attach it to the fence and valuable time was wasted attempting to sort out the problem.
Martin Pearse whipped out his wire-cutters, forced an entrance big enough to take a man wearing webbing, and within a minute he had penetrated the Bastille grounds.
Inside The Fat Man’s house, the twinkle of lights could be seen.
Then they took their first casualty. A sergeant, one of Marlin Pearse’s assault team, was hit in the buttocks, putting him out of action and cutting the house-fighting team down to three men.
Martin’s driver/medic, Barry Skinner, had already pulled the vehicle over to the opposite side of the road. Now he dragged his casualty off the vehicle and into the ditch, and while he busied himself sorting out the sergeant’s wound, the casualty opened his own drip and prepared to put it in himself. Fortunately for him, he didn’t need it.
Once the enemy fire was neutralised near his entrance, Marlin Pearse led his two remaining men into the garden, stepping on a guard sleeping under his blanket on the lawn. As the fence began to burn, they could see that the guards had been asleep in shell scrapes.
Marlin carried a forty-round magazine on his AK-47 rifle and had six thirty-round magazines in reserve which gave him a larger magazine capacity than the normal Rhodesian issue FN. It was also easier to handle in confined spaces. He also carried five explosive hand grenades, five _Knock-Knock_ charges, a 9 millimetre pistol and a spare magazine.
Meanwhile, at the opposite side of the target, Sergeant Major _Petrol Paul_ and Major Dave Dodson were attempting to batter down the two locked front gates. Everything went well for _Petrol Paul_ and he crashed through his entrance just as planned, breaking the lock, the machinegunner opening up immediately.
But the angle of the commander’s approach was wrong and they failed to hit the gate at full speed - and the gate, padlock and chains stayed firmly intact.
As they bounced off the gate, the commander realised there was no time for another try. He ran to the gate to blow an entrance with a _Gatecrasher_, while his team began firing to keep interference from the guards around the gate to a minimum.
But the driver had left the lights on and Dodson realised he was about to be silhouetted, making him a wonderful target.
He hesitated for about ten seconds then sprinted around the vehicle, switched the lights off himself, then returned to the gate and blew it down. Both vehicles were then half-in, half-out of the gates and every man proceeded to machinegun the house... the vehicles ... servants quarters ... anything they saw moving.
There was quite a bit of return fire. The commander’s vehicle took a couple of strikes and the driver was hit in the back.
Once they had suppressed all opposition from the thirty or so guards there that night, everyone on the Nyerere Road side of the target began rocketing and bunker bombing the house.
Dodson dealt with Nkomo’s lounge by lobbing in a bunker bomb. The lounge immediately burst into flames. There was no chance of anyone being left alive in there.
Masonry was crashing… timber was falling and the lights were blown out. Fire had quickly taken hold and everywhere, there was smoke and flames. All the SAS were hit by falling debris.
The noise was fantastic. The exploding bunker bombs, machinegunning, rocketing appeared magnified and an incredible amount of smallarms fire all added to the commotion. The commander removed his earplugs for a second and was nearly deafened. Even when he put them back, it was still noisy.
It was a spectacular sight as well. The machineguns had one tracer in three rounds so all they could see were red sheets of tracers. The tracer provided the storm troopers with excellent light, enabling them to see the target.
Mac McIntosh and his crew, parked outside the main gates, were having a grandstand view of it all.
At the Zambian President’s palace just five hundred metres away, the presidential guard began firing, their red and green tracer was criss-crossing and ricocheting across the night sky. But it was only a token show. Nothing and no one came near the raiders.
Soon the initial resistance from Nkomo’s guards was subdued and the din began to subside. The dark humps of fifteen bodies lay sprawled around the grounds, the remainder keeping a low profile, discretion being the better part of valour.
“There was a real ding-dong battle going on. When the firing died down, there were some pretty big explosions,” a British diplomat watching the proceedings from the safety of his bedroom window, recalled later.
Elsewhere in the capital, Zambians began to run into the streets in their underwear. At first they thought there had been a coup because the firing went on for such a long time and came from the vicinity of State House.
Martin Pearse and his assault team knew exactly which bedroom Nkomo slept in, but their original plan to throw in a bunker bomb was frustrated as the window was barred.
￼![287 - Bastille](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/287%20-%20Bastille.png)
They doubled around to the back door, blew the lock off and hurried inside, fighting against time, dust and darkness.
Faced with a two-sided passageway and four doors, they set about clearing the house with chilling precision. They only had fifteen minutes to do the job, find Nkomo and kill him.
The dust and smoke hanging in the air posed a major problem and they had difficulty breathing.
The wooden floor had been torn away in Nkomo’s bedroom. Aided by the torch strapped to the underside of his AK, Martin Pearse fired into every likely hiding place.
But there was no sign of Nkomo. All they found was his general’s uniform.
By now, the command Dakota flying somewhere over Zambia had begun to pick up the first rather garbled and excited police reports of heavy firing.
Meanwhile, Martin and his men were scuttling down the passageways on their way to clearing the bathroom and storeroom. But again, there was no sign of life. The house was burning furiously. There was smoke and dust almost everywhere and it was all fairly confusing.
There was only one room left to clear now. Would _The Fat Man_ be hiding in there?
As they burst into the room, which was untouched by all the bunker bombing, someone opened up on them from under a bed and another man shot at them from inside a cupboard. The enemy were trapped and there was no way out for them. They were fighting to the bitter end.
One round whistled through the back of Martin’s trousers giving him a flesh wound and one of his companions was also hit in the buttocks. It was becoming a popular target.
Martin and his corporal grenaded the room and the third member of their party cleared the room with a very long burst from his cut-down RPD light machinegun. Then Martin and the corporal returned to the room and killed the two ZIPRA men.
The Bastille had fallen. But still there was no sign of Joshua Nkomo. Martin called the overall commander up on his radio to report he had now finished.
By now, Dave Dodson had cleared the lounge on his side of the house and the SAS reluctantly came to the conclusion that Nkomo had not even been in the house. Although the externally -based agent had seen him go into the house, he had not seen him come out. Had he been there that night, there is no doubt what the outcome would have been. It was a bitter moment, but there was no time for regrets.
Martin had done an excellent job and his handling of the operation was one of the main reasons for his being awarded the Silver Cross of Rhodesia, the country’s second highest gallantry award.
The action had been over incredibly quickly and Martin and his team left the ruins and hurried to their vehicle which had two flat tyres, two casualties on it and a round in the radiator. They managed to drive it away, met up with the overall commander and his two vehicles, and then drove around the corner.
Then, into the midst of the frenzy came a Renault car with a white man at the wheel. He stamped on his brakes, mystified at the crazy goings on that morning. Someone fired a round over his head and he suddenly lost all interest, reversing and taking off at full speed. Then he was gone.
At the rendezvous point around the corner, they stopped to reorganise, while the commander grabbed a quick smoke.
They were all very pleased. The entire operation had been pulled off in 25 minutes and all their detailed planning had paid handsome dividends. It had been unnecessary to give orders during the raid, for each man knew exactly what to do at every stage.
Zambian police signals were now reporting that Lusaka was being bombed. Five minutes later, police headquarters told stations not to publish the incident over their radios.
The situation in the capital was being described by the police as “too serious”. “It’s the maningis (whites),” one station reported.
Another could not find its commandant to organise a reaction force ... while police elsewhere were racing around in their vehicle. But it had a blow out, overturned and three policemen were killed.
The result was that no one appeared to oppose the strike force, which by now had decided to abandon Martin Pearse’s ailing Sabre.
A couple of men discussed leaving their “Rhodesia ls Super” calling card on the Sabre for Nkomo, explaining their visit had been in return for the Viscount atrocities, but in the end, good sense prevailed and they reckoned he would get the message anyway.
After stripping the vehicle of most of its equipment, they doused it with petrol then threw a white phosphorus grenade underneath. Their own engines roared into life once more and they began to pull out of town.
The blazing vehicle had come to the end of its days outside the home of the Zambian Minister of Tourism. The events in the capital that night could hardly be expected to attract visitors to the country.
They passed a number of military vehicles heading in the direction of Nkomo’s suburb, but they were on the other side of the carriageway and the Zambians showed no interest in the convoy as it observed the speed limit and made its way out of town.
The vehicles turned left at the main north-south highway and then it was on to the _Muppet Show_, the roundabout with the glass skyscraper. Now for the first time since the operation had begun, the tension eased slightly and they could relax and have a proper smoke, swop accounts - and hope that everything was going well for Rich Stannard and his team at the remaining target, the Liberation Centre.
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
Rich Stannard and his second-in-command, Billy Gardner had decided to carry out a quick reconnaissance before mounting their attack. They were scaling a two metre-high security fence when the sounds of firing could be heard coming from Nkomo’s home.
With a final push from his sergeant, Lieutenant Stannard reached the top of the fence and from his perch, quickly gave the courtyard, the military transport yard, and the buildings the once over.
There was a light on in an office directly beneath him and he reasoned it had to be the operations room - and he knew he would be in with a fair chance of finding someone in there.
But now the Liberation Centre security guards were becoming curious about the unmistakable sounds of shooting from across the city. Rich watched as a couple of them strolled out of the steel gates and walked off down the street to investigate, totally oblivious of the two SAS men spying on them from the wall, and others lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows.
Sergeant Billy Gardner took a bunker bomb from his webbing and heaved it straight into the lighted window of the enemy operations room.
A split second later the bomb found its mark and the room burst into flames. There was one almighty thunderclap and the roof lifted and flew through the air.
Both men leapt down, taking cover behind the wall. A fraction of a second later the metal whistled uncomfortably close to their heads and clattered down centimetres behind them in the street.
The sergeant had earned himself a new nickname - _Billy Bunker Bomb_.
They dashed for their vehicles and roared around the comer to the entrance. The front and rear machinegunners were poised to take on any opposition.
As the security guards had already left to investigate the sounds of firing - an action that undoubtedly saved their lives that night - the raiders met no resistance as they swung through the open gates, the twin machineguns on the two Sabres spraying a deadly hail of hot lead in all directions.
The small guardhouse, still with one man on duty, came under a withering rate of fire, and bullets carried death to the sentry.
A well-placed phosphorus grenade spread the contents of the outside toilet all over the show. ZIPRA were known to hide their arms caches and often themselves in the toilets, thinking that well-bred Rhodesians would avoid them.
At this stage, the city lights were doused and air-raid sirens whined across the city as the Zambians thought the Rhodesians were about to carry out an air raid.
But aided by the light of the still-blazing ops room, Rich Stannard and his team were able to continue raking the area with machinegun fire, spraying rounds at the buildings and parked vehicles.
Within thirty seconds, the lieutenant reckoned they had done enough damage to the entrance, and had put a stop to all possible resistance.
They ceased firing for a moment. Off in the distance, other explosions told their tale.
Positioning one vehicle at the entrance with two men on board to take care ofany outside interference or any fleeing enemy, the lieutenant hurriedly split the rest of the operators into two demolition teams.
While one team destroyed all the enemy vehicles in the car park, the others were to deal with the office block.
There were three blocks of new prefabricated asbestos buildings, totalling nine offices in all, far more than they had anticipated. One block housed ZIPRA offices, another belonged to the South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO). and the third to the South African ANC.
The offices had not long been completed and the Rhodesian intelligence agencies had told the lieutenant that they would be empty. But the soldiers not only found them bulging with propaganda, but with desks, swivel chairs, maps on the walls, boxes and cabinets full of files, and a huge SWAPO flag gracing Liberation Centre.
Rich yanked open the filing cabinets to find an impressive amount of paperwork, all of it meticulously kept. It was obvious that strict office routine had been followed in the terror centre, and there was much that might prove useful to the Rhodesian and South African war effort.
But the pressure was really on now, and the limited time-frame precluded even a cursory search of the files. Even if they had the time, they did not have the necessary trucks to cart away such a wealth of paper work.
But destroying it was the next best thing. That way, ZIPRA, SWAPO and the ANC would not have it either.
With precision timing, the two teams quickly dealt with the offices. It was a slick operation, previously rehearsed so that they could move far and fast.
With one man at the front with an RPD for protection, the others in the demolition team followed closely behind. Second in line was the team commander - Rich Stannard or Billy Gardner. Swiftly they moved in to break a window in an office, a preliminary to sticking a two kilogram charge on the walls with _Wonder Glue_. Another man followed up to run out it long _Cordtex_ ringmain ... and the man behind him would connect it up.
It was a fluid motion and by the time the man at the back of the line had connected up the ringmain, the two team commanders had moved on to the next offices.
In the car park, the thirty-odd vehicles were being attended to by two other soldiers.
There were Land-Rovers, buses, station wagons, a truck filled with ammunition. Peugeots, Fiats, five-tonners and ten-tonners with crane attachments, and SWAPO vehicles that were about to be used to deploy trained insurgents to their drop-off point for infiltration into South West Africa (Namibia).
The two men had not expected to find so many vehicles, but had wisely taken along extra explosives, which they had made up in Kariba, and there were enough to take care of all the vehicles.
They slapped the _Wonder Glue_ on to their charges, and while one man ran from vehicle to vehicle sticking the charges under the axles, on the engine block and under the differential, the other ran out a big ringmain from all the vehicles to the main initiation set.
Having finished connecting up the offices, Rich Stannard hurried to the armoury. It was located next to the burning ops room and it was imperative they deal with it before the blaze reached the vast quantities of weaponry.
Rich found a sergeant major already there. He had left his colleague in charge of the Sabre at the entrance while he went in search of a long-admired Russian pistol. But his luck was out that night and he had to be content with a holster.
By now, two other men joined them and the sergeant major remained to help place their charges in strategic positions. In addition, the enemy’s own TNT was positioned where it could do the most harm.
Then the anxious voice of Major Dave Dodson waiting patiently by the roundabout, came up on the radio to warn Rich Stannard and his team that they were running out of time.
By now however, the Liberation Centre task was all but finished. The sergeant major returned to take up his position in the Sabre at the entrance.
A huge ringmain led from the motor transport park: another connected the charges in the offices and the armoury.., and a pre-cut piece of safety fuse with a five-minute burning time was to be used to blow all the targets up at once.
The voice of the commander came over the radio one more time to warn them to get out.
Suddenly, a white Peugeot car shot around the corner and unintentionally drove straight into the path of the Sabre parked at the entrance of Liberation Centre.
The car contained a member of the ZIPRA High Command, not that the Rhodesians knew that at the time.
The soldiers blasted away putting belt-after-belt of machingun fire into the car. The vehicle crashed to a halt. The windscreen was shattered. The driver’s head was severed.
Above the roar of the machineguns, the other passengers could be heard screaming “Comrade, Comrade!” The SAS continued raking the enemy car until it resembled a sieve, and when the holes were later counted, there were 83.
Seconds after the machineguns opened up, Rich Stannard lit the safety fuse on the ringmain connecting the offices and armoury, and a corporal lit his fuse on the car park ringmain. Then they dashed for their own vehicles.
But Rich had just one more job to do before leaving Liberation Centre.
Sprinting to the middle of the compound, he yanked down the Zambian flag and darted off with his much-prized capture.
The ops room was still blazing furiously as they roared down the road at high speed, putting as much distance between themselves and the forthcoming blast. Down the unlit streets they raced, fighting against time to meet up with the others just beyond the roundabout.
The sirens wailed. Lusaka knew there was more to come.
At the roundabout, the men who had not long ago blasted Nkomo’s personal command centre off the face of the earth, leaned back in their vehicles and chatted. Some smoked. The atmosphere was fairly relaxed. Not that they were out of the woods yet.
The commander glanced at his watch once again. Time was getting on.
The rumble of heavy vehicle movement reached them across the early morning. Was that the Zambian Army reacting? Would Rich Stannard’s escape route be blocked?
But they saw no sign. Then the two speeding SAS Sabres came into sight. Rich and his men had resisted the temptation to have a quick blast at the glass skyscraper. Time had not been on their side that night.
A mere twenty minutes had elapsed since Rich Stannard and his team had fired their first shots and the overall commander was anxious to know if it had been long enough to complete their task “What a question,” the tired, but smiling lieutenant thought, but assured him all was well.
Quickly, they reorganised, spreading their kit out evenly among the five remaining vehicles.
Then they waited for the explosion.
A huge orange mushroom billowed up into the sky, followed five seconds later by an enormous thunderclap which rumbled over the capital.
“Just check that!” one impressed soldier exclaimed as Liberation Centre went up, plus all three office blocks, all the vehicles, the armoury, the security walls, nearby houses and parts of the road, the entire complex being flattened with the help of ZIPRA’s own weaponry.
When the dust finally settled and the fire burned itself out all that was left was a massive crater marking the spot where the armoury had once been.
A year later, after the war had ended. Rich Stannard drove past the spot where Liberation Centre had stood to find it being rebuilt. As he went past, he waved at the men putting the roof on the centre and they waved back. He couldn’t help thinking how ironic life was sometimes.
By now the Zambians had had enough. The sirens were still wailing out their urgent messages as the civilians came streaming out of the homes, many still in their nightclothes, their suitcases and chattels stacked high on their heads, their bleary-eyed children trailing behind them.
They were frightened and confused about the events that night and ignored the Rhodesians, as they kept their heads down and bounded through the bush near the SAS. All they knew was that they had to get out of town and fast.
The men responsible for all their troubles were also leaving the capital. It was 04h00 and soon it would be light enough for them to be seen by anyone on the lookout for them.
But on the long journey south, there was no one to stop them. The nearest they got to potential trouble was when they saw police talking to the driver of the Zambian Army Land-Rover they had seen on their infiltration. But it seemed that they had nothing more serious on their mind than seeking out drunken drivers.
The Zambian Army knew that Rhodesian troops dressed in “Zambian camouflage” and driving Land-Rovers were responsible, and they talked of manning roadblocks to cut off the attackers. But it never happened.
The SAS strike force meanwhile were making their way southwards. Ahead lay the Kafue bridge - the last real obstacle. If they were prevented from crossing, they planned to destroy their vehicles, then set off on fool sorting out their exfiltration later.
But when they stopped to pick up the small observation party monitoring the bridge, there was nothing to report. There was no one to bar the way and the only person they saw was a rather sleepy sentry. As before, they experienced a wonderful feeling of relief as they sped over the bridge. Now all they had to worry about were the Zambian MiGs and a possible army ambush group.
They hit the dirt road at 05h50 and continued on their way uneventfully passing villages. It was getting light and now and then they waved to the locals. After the rigours of the night and the effects of perspiration, most of the camouflage cream had come off, so there could be no mistaking the travellers for Zambian Army.
The astonished locals did a quick double-take and when they realised the soldiers harboured no aggressive intentions towards them, waved back at the Rhodesians.
As dawn broke over Lusaka, curious Zambians were driving to inspect the damage at Nkomo’s house, and by 07h00, a large crowd had gathered outside the burned-out shell opposite the State President’s home, only to be kept at bay by troops. The roof of the building had long ago fallen in.
An hour later, the SAS reached the bad dirt road. By now. most men were feeling totally exhausted and medic Bruce Langley came to their aid with large bottles of anti-fatigue tonic.
By 10h00, they cut a landing zone and called in the choppers to take out the three wounded men. The commander was glad to get rid of them as they were beginning to suffer on the bad bumpy road.
The convoy continued on its way, eventually arriving at a particularly bad stretch of road where the SAS’s problems were multiplied by the already churned mud. It was here that Lieutenant Phil Brooke and his team had been abandoned with their broken-down vehicle.
“How’d it go?” they enquired eagerly, disappointed at not having made the trip themselves, but anxious to learn the outcome. The six men were told of the happenings in Lusaka a few hours before and Rich Stannard showed off his captured flag.
The SAS attempted to drive the vehicles through the mud but finally had to resort to manpower, with one man driving and the others up to their knees in mud.
The war and the Zambian MiGs were forgotten as everyone slogged it out in the ever-worsening quagmire. Rich Stannard’s vehicle, _Rubber Duck_, was the only one that made it without getting stuck. _Petrol Paul’s_ vehicle broke down completely and the steering rod broke.
By now the men were totally exhausted, despite much guzzling of anti-fatigue tonic. The commander realised there was a chance of saving the vehicle, but they were too tired and there was the very real danger of the MiGs being scrambled to search for them.
Besides, there was still the possibility of a Zambian Army company waiting for them along their exfiltration route. They had seen no sign of them on the way in. but they were not prepared to take any chances, and the commander decided to destroy _Petrol Paul’s_ vehicle. But they decided against destroying Phil Brooke’s Sabre and within 500 metres of towing it down the road, the engine roared into life. Knowing he could have made the trip to Lusaka after all, Phil Brooke was not impressed.
Unbeknown to the weary men, a Zambian MiG had been deployed to search for them, but when it was pointed out to the pilot he was heading the wrong way and had to go in the opposite direction, he was heard to reply: “No. no. It is _not_ my job!” And with that, he returned to base.
The Zambians however had not linked the earlier sighting of the _Sea Lion_ with the raid and three days later deployed the MiGs to the wrong end of the lake where they proceeded to attack a Zambian Army convoy.
Eighteen hours after _Sea Lion_ had delivered them to the Zambian shore, they arrived back at the beachhead. It was midday and much had happened in those eighteen hours. Despite their exhaustion they were all excited and as they waited for the ferry to come and collect them, they told the beach party of the events in Lusaka.
The beach party had good reason to feel pleased with themselves, too. They had done a good job and reported that their only experience had been when a Zambian police boat had come roaring along. The Zambians saw them protecting the beach, then disappeared at high speed, never to be seen again.
Soon the ferry could be seen coming to take them home. The ramp came down and the vehicles drove on. The ferry cast off immediately and away they went, soon enjoying a welcoming cup oftea. The pick-up had taken place in broad daylight, but there had been no one around to stop them.
Someone had stashed six bottles of rum away for their journey home but by the time they were remembered and brought out to lace their tea. some of the men had fallen asleep. Others recall doing justice to a couple of cups of the special brew.
Then came the fantastic sight of a Rhodesian helicopter. It hovered above the ferry and lowered a crate of beers which were consumed with great delight by those troops still battling to keep awake. Then at last, the Rhodesian shore.
The troops drove off, the vehicles were resprayed, and the operators returned to Salisbury by road together with a little rubber duck which had gone all the way to Lusaka and back. The operation was finally over and they looked forward to reading about it in the following day’s papers. Not of course that the press would get to know all the fascinating details of one of the most dramatic raids of the war.
Major Dave Dodson boarded a boat and hurried to Kariba where he climbed into a helicopter. He was taken to Kariba Heights and from there by car to the airport.
Within two hours of arriving in Rhodesia, he was reporting back to the ComOps planners and intelligence chiefs. It had been a long worrying night for them, too, and there was much for the SAS officer to tell.
In Britain meanwhile, the Foreign Office deplored the attack, which was also condemned by the UN Secretary General, Dr Kurt Waldheim.
Nkomo, humiliated before the delegates of the Afro-Asian Peoples’ Solidarity Organisation conference meeting in Lusaka - he had been attending their opening session at the time of the strike - vowed to take his revenge.
Reported to be “shaken but determined,” he told hundreds of people standing outside the shell of his home: “I can assure you the Patriotic Front is going to punish these savages.”
He said that he had been home at the time of the raid and had escaped through a toilet window. “I had to get out as best I could, “ he explained.
At a press conference in Salisbury, General Walls commented: “I find it hilarious to think of him escaping through a lavatory window - that alone would have caused the damage.” As he spoke, Rhodesian war planes were blasting ZIPRA’s conventional terror camp at Mulungushi for the third time that week.

The Zambian ground raid had been part of a strategy to ensure the safety of voters, General Walls told the world. In the face of the Patriotic Front’s threat to take Rhodesia by force, the military had to take the necessary action against those who did not take up Rhodesia’s amnesty offer.
“Some of our resources have to be used offensively. We have a job to do. We can’t sit back and see people killed and maimed,” he said.
The SAS thought it had just been bad luck Nkomo had not been at home. It would be the nearest the Rhodesians would come to assassinating Nkomo. For it was the last attempt on his life, and the ZIPRA leader later moved to Ndola.
But was it bad luck? The SAS had not got their man for the very simple reason he had been tipped off. That was why the guard had been increased.
A voice over the telephone had told of the impending attack 12 hours before the SAS had struck. Nkomo, his number two and Dumiso Dabengwa told the ComOps hierarchy this after the war.
Even more amazing, the initial telephone call had been made from ComOps building itself where a well-placed British agent was employed. The man responsible had telephoned British officials in Lusaka, who had passed on the message to Nkomo.
The ComOps spy is alleged to have deliberately fed Prime Minister Ian Smith and security chiefs inaccurate and misleading information to further the ends of the British. According to some sources, much information he gave them was watered down. (Security chiefs eventually worked out where the spy leaks were coming from and disinformation was in turn fed to him. But unearthing a spy is a lengthy process and concrete evidence hard to get.)
Joshua Nkomo, who said in his own book that the security forces missed him by an hour, was never again seen wearing his general’s uniform, which had hung in his bedroom on the night of the raid.
As a result of the ground strike, President Kenneth Kaunda imposed a curfew in the border regions. An appeal was made for all able-bodied men with military training to report for army duty in an attempt to boost Zambia’s 8 000-strong army. In the event, the ZIPRA invasion did not take place prior to the elections as initially thought. Nkomo had not however cancelled his plans. ZANLA did not cause too much trouble either and the five-day one-man-one-vote elections were enormously successful, bringing in moderate Bishop Abel Muzorewa as the country’s first black Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
Never had a white tribe worked so hard to transfer power to blacks.
Some 64.45 percent of the country’s electorate had voted. What now of the black nationalists” claims that they were fighting for the country’s liberation? Could the war be seen in terms of a black-white confrontation any longer?
Outgoing Prime Minister Ian Smith - soon to become Minister Without Portfolio of the new State of Zimbabwe Rhodesia - now asked the world: “What more do you want us to do?”
