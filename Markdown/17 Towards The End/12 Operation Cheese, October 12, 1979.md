Rhodesia now began to turn her attention to hitting the Zambian economy and putting the big squeeze on President Kenneth Kaunda.  
While Kaunda had been forced to reopen his border with Rhodesia the previous October to import maize from the south to feed his starving nation, the border was still not as fully open as Rhodesia would have liked.  
How could they make Kaunda more reliant on Rhodesia when he still had the ability to import and export via the all-important Tazara (TanZam) rail link to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam? The track was Zambia’s lifeline to the port, moving 25 000 tons of cargo a month into Zambia, and carrying forty percent of the country’s foreign trade, including copper, upon which Zambia’s national economy hinged.  
If Rhodesia wanted to force Kaunda to use the southern communications routes more fully, they would have to cut his rail links to the north. They would have to destroy the biggest stretch of track that they could.  
Rhodesia’s intelligence gatherers and military strategists - tasked with studying where the vulnerabilities lay in neighbouring countries and the impact of destroying such targets - had long ago realised the significance of the Tazara line.  
Crucial to the success of the line was the giant Chambeshi rail bridge straddling the Chambeshi River in north-eastern Zambia, the longest bridge on the rail track. There was a major road bridge 600 metres away and that too was vitally-important to the Zambian economy, and used to export cement and petroleum products to Burundi.  
All this information had been filed in a dossier until the time was right. In August, 1978, the file was reopened. The SAS began making their appreciations on destroying the two bridges, and an explosives expert had worked out how many charges it would take to drop both of them.  
But it was ruled the time was not right, and it was not Rhodesian policy to attack economic targets in neighbouring countries; _only_ terrorist ones.  
The demolition calculations were filed away and the frustrated SAS commanders kept hoping that perhaps one day they would get a crack at the bridges.  
Then in early September, 1979, a few days before the start of the Lancaster House Conference, the green light was finally givcn. Fortunately, the homework had already been done: the calculations were taken out, dusted off- and Operation _Cheese_ got underway.  
The logistics of mounting such an attack were formidable, with distance the major problem.  
The two targets were 320 kilometres (200 miles) from the Rhodesian border, 750 kilometres (470 miles) from Kabrit Barracks. It was to be the furthest north that ground troops had operated during the entire war and the problems were enormous.  
All they needed was for one man to be seriously injured or for them to be dropped in the wrong place and they would have a major crisis on their hands. The enormous distances involved meant that there was no way anyone in Rhodesia would be able to help them. The distances were even beyond the capabilities of the long-haul Bell 205s.  
They would be totally on their own, without help or the prospect of getting any, hundreds of kilometres inside hostile territory.  
The mission posed a number of important questions. What was the situation regarding the local population in the area? Where were they, and how many were there… and how close did they live to the bridge? Was the bridge guarded? And where was the nearest police post?  
How would they get to the target? How would they be able to spread their charges around the bridges without the Zambians raising the alarm?  
And the biggest worry of all - how would they make good their escape once the bridges were blown?  
For once the big bang went off and the alarm was raised, it was still a very long way back to the border.  
The defences at the bridge and the situation of the locals were of prime importance, and, as they had no intelligence available on the area, an agent, based externally, was dispatched to drive through the area and carry out a reconnaissance.  
He reported that there was a small police guard post near the bridges and that locals lived near the riverbanks along the entire length of Chambeshi.  
In outline, Operation _Cheese_ promised to be fairly straightforward.  
Being so far from home, it was out of the question to drive to the target as they had in Operation _Bastille_, or be choppered in as in Operation _Carpet_. The decision was therefore made for them. They had to make a parachute drop by night.  
A four-man freefall team was to jump in first, carry out a reconnaissance of the two bridges and check out the defences. The remaining 12 men would parachute in, using static line chutes and bring in the explosives, boats and other equipment. Then the whole force of 16 men would travel upriver to the bridges.  
It was crucial for the pathfinder/reconnaissance team to know exactly where they were being dropped. But how could they find the most suitable spot to land in?  
Mission commander Major Dave Dodson briefed SAS/SB liaison man Stu Hulley-Miller. “I need a place where there is no population, near a recognisable feature, near a fiver. I’ve got to go downstream, so I want to be upstream ...”  
Stu went off to find out everything he could about the area, a task which meant an on-site inspection.  
Pilot Jack Malloch was called in to help and late one night, Stu and Jack flew off from Salisbury and headed across the border en route for north-east Zambia.  
It was cold and windy and the chill night air blew in through the open door of Jack’s DC-7, but he had come prepared and laid on coffee, _Coke_ and sandwiches.  
It took three hours of flying by a roundabout, devious route to get to the fiver itself. Now, they had to find a suitable spot where the pathfinder team could be dropped. But try as they may, they could find nowhere. The trouble was they could not really see any recognisable features because of haze near the ground.  
They had no option. They would just have to turn around and go home.  
On the next trip, mission commander Dave Dodson went along to see if he could help pinpoint a position. It was still a difficult job. but they knew they could not go home again without finding a dropping zone.  
Jack Malloch kept circling, searching… and eventually it dawned on them how to solve their problem.  
As they flew over the Chambeshi, they could see that the moon cast a reflection on the water, and, with that to aid them, they were able to recognise various features.  
Using the reflection from the water as a guide, they were at last able to find a DZ - a sparsely populated area near the river forty kilometres (25 miles)south-west of the two bridges, but unfortunately downstream from the targets.  
Back home at Darwendale Dam, they carried out their trials, it was a bright moonlit night, as the plane, bearing the soldiers, approached the dam. As always, the rehearsals were realistic and they were wearing the kit and equipment they would wear on the night of their deployment - and it was extremely heavy.  
Below, Stu Hulley-Miller was in a boat, just in case he was needed to fish anyone out of the water.  
The dispatchers could see the reflection on the water. The paras dropped to earth and the wind blew. Luckily, despite the strong wind, Stu did not have to go fishing that night. All but Bob McKenna landed on the shore.  
Aerial photographic interpretation of the bridges had already been done to enable the demolition calculations to be worked out, but another photographic run was made to get an up-to-date picture of the targets.  
They would be going for overkill, taking fifty percent more explosives than they really needed. Having gone that far, they were not about to take any chances.  
The main party was to take a ton of explosives, an inflatable rubber boat with an outboard motor and several new canoes. It was quite a cargo to haul along, and much time had to be spent packing and rearranging loads as well as on the practice drops.  
Once at the Chambeshi River, every boat would have a specific task and it was essential that equipment be precisely loaded into the correct canoes to aid the actions at the different targets. Many days and nights were to be spent at Darwendale Dam, practising canoe and inflatable boat techniques, formations and relative speeds.  
It was crucial that the bridges were not only blown, but blown effectively and to do that they needed to lay some of their many charges below water level. The soldiers moved out to a bridge on the Hunyani River, outside Salisbury to rehearse positioning the charges.  
They also needed to test a new item of equipment, essential to the demolition task. In addition to the many charges they were to spread around the bridges, they were also to use an experimental device, a demolition net, which was to be used on the rail bridge alone - the major prize of the mission.  
There were to be three 100 kilogram charges submerged on one side of the centre pier- the thickest of the three rail piers- and the demolition net would be on the opposite side of the pier.  
The idea was that the net would detonate a micro-second before the three charges, blowing water away from the pier and creating an air bubble. This would make the charges more effective. For when they detonated, there would no longer be the enormous water resistance on the far side of the pier.  
While not a new concept in military circles, it was the first time it had been used by the Rhodesians.  
Spreading the many charges all over the spans and piers was going to be a time consuming business and the longer they stayed at the bridges, the greater the risks of interference from the Zambians.  
Much careful thought went into their escape plans and they felt it feasible to parachute in a take-apart Land-Rover, but trials proved it to be an impractical idea.  
In the end they decided that the best plan was to hijack a vehicle to make their getaway. And it had to be big enough to take all 16 operators as well as their kit, canoes and boat.  
It meant that once the bridges had blown they would have to drive through Chambeshi town itself and another town called Mpika.  
The maps they had were not good and while they felt Chambeshi town would probably be a small place, they were not sure about Mpika, or whether or not there were police there.  
In the event of them getting clear of the two towns, they were then to travel cross-country until they got within helicopter range of Rhodesia where they would call in the choppers to carry them back home.  
Their escape hinged on their finding a suitable vehicle. They hoped they would be able to capture one in the early hours of the morning. If not, they would have a severe problem.  
Finally, the order came for the rehearsals and preparations to cease, and the operation to begin.  
On September 12, the 16 men moved out to their staging area at Fylde, a secret military airfield near Hartley, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the capital.  
The four freefallers, faces black with camo cream and led by Major Dodson, climbed into their DC-7 and headed north into the night.  
There was a heavy haze over the Chambeshi that night and they were unable to find their DZ, and had no choice but to turn around and head back home.  
Everyone was disappointed. They had been keyed up to the limit for danger; now, instead they had to relax and unwind again.  
As they climbed into their trucks and made their way back to Salisbury, they consoled themselves with the thought that they would soon be back at the airfield for another attempt.  
But they had to wait until the next moon phase.  
The mission commander was in some ways relieved. The extra time the delay gave them meant they were able to polish their plans, sort out a lot of small problems, which perhaps would not prove so small with the targets so far from home.  
On October 3, it was all systems go again and at 22h00, the freefall team once more climbed into the DC-7 and took off for Zambia.  
Once in the area of the bridges, the heavily-laden freefallers staggered to their feet. They had so much kit on they looked like hunchbacks.  
But pilot Jack Malioch, and dispatcher Frank Hales, were struggling to find the DZ. Twenty minutes later they still had not located it and the freefallers were still standing, weighed down by their unbearably heavy packs.  
Eventually, the commander had had enough.  
That was it. he said. They were not jumping. They all lumbered back to their seats.  
Suddenly the “GO, GO. GO” rang out through the plane as Jack and Frank finally recognised the DZ.  
The tour freefailers struggled from their seats and moved towards the door.  
This time there was no postponement and at almost midnight, the team, plus their box of canoes and other equipment fell into the night from 13 000 feet above ground level.  
For just under a minute they fell until their chutes opened, and for another couple of minutes they drove their canopies to the DZ.  
As they floated down, they looked around in the light cast from the moon to see if everything had gone to plan.  
It was with horror they realised that one of the chutes was missing. It had obviously had a malfunction and its load had to be lying smashed on the ground. They could only hope that it was equipment and not a freefaller.  
It was with much relief they learned it was equipment and not a team member. But it meant that somewhere out in the bush were two canoes, plus a spare, which they were relying on to get them to the bridges to carry out their reconnaissance. It was a serious problem.  
The HF radio was also missing. Fortunately, the commander had taken the precaution of getting one of the freefallers to carry a spare.  
For all that night and half the next day they searched for the canoes, but without success. In the end the commander decided the time had come to abandon the hunt.  
It was bad luck but the commander decided to carry on. They would just have to walk to the bridges. It would take a considerable time to walk to the river and get back to the DZ and it would drastically alter their original timings. But better that than abort the mission.  
The commander radioed the SAS HQ in Rhodesia to tell of their contingency plans. The main body of men, who would be joining them in a few days, would now have to bring in replacement canoes.  
Two-and-a-half days later, the four weary men arrived at a wide tributary that came in from the west and joined up with the Chambeshi.  
Leaving one man to guard their kit and clothing, Major Dodson, Lieutenant Phil Brooke and Lance Corporal Andy Standish-White stripped off, and with just a silenced .22 pistol between them, the three naked men swam to the bridges.  
There was no one around and the three men were fairly relaxed as they swam under the two monster bridges. The commander made a mental note of the two-metre-high ledge inside the rail bridge… they could use that to rest their explosives on.  
From bank-to-bank, the channel was 400 metres wide, sufficient to handle the annual floods during the wet season. But at that time it was only 200 metres wide and four metres deep.  
Their measurements of the bridge confirmed exactly what the aerial photographic interpreters had told them. They knew that there was no need to change the plan: that there would be more than enough explosives coming in.  
They confirmed the presence of a guard at the bridge, swam back across the fiver and away they went. The recce had gone well. Now for the real thing.  
Four days after setting off at the start of their trek, they arrived back at their DZ. They had walked 100 kilometres (62 miles) and would be able to rest up while awaiting the arrival of the 12 men in the main party who would be bringing in the explosives and canoes.  
At 01h00 on October 8, the rest of the operators arrived without incident, parachuting into Zambia from 1 000 feet above ground level.  
From then until sun-up, all 16 men busied themselves, digging pits to hide the parachutes and packing material. Then they hid the explosives and boats in the bush, posted sentries and tried to sleep.  
All was quiet. It was the usual sultry October day in the bush.  
In the early afternoon the sentries noticed smoke from a bushfire in the distance. But it was too far away to threaten them.  
The men continued to doze in the heat of the day.  
Suddenly, at 15h00, the situation changed dramatically and the alarmed sentries hurriedly ran to shake everyone awake.  
A new fire had flared up and it was sweeping nearer to them. It was already only a 100 metres or so from them and their massive cache of explosives and equipment  
Dave and his 21C, Bob McKenna, had a hurried discussion. While they were whispering about what they should do, they heard several men shouting at each other from the direction of the fire.  
The soldiers’ first thoughts were that they had somehow been discovered... hundreds of kilometres behind enemy lines with no means of escape but their feet. Quickly, they spread out into their positions and prepared for a fight.  
Then a sentry spotted the source of the voices. It was a group of African hunters who had obviously started the fire to flush out game.  
They were not directly a threat to the soldiers as they only carried spears, but they _could_ report them to the authorities.  
The hunters were unaware they were within 100 metres of 16 heavily armed Rhodesian soldiers, and, as long as they remained unaware the SAS would not harm them.  
But right now, the fire was a much bigger problem. As they hid and watched, the fire crept dangerously closer to them and their cache of high explosives.  
It was imperative they stop it before it reached the explosives. They would have to act fast and without being seen. But luck was on their side that day.  
A buck suddenly broke from the smoking bush and the hunters gave chase - away from the soldiers.  
As soon as they were out of sight the 16 men turned firefighters as, for an hour, they cleared firebreaks and battled the flames. With one final concerted effort, they managed to stop the fire just twenty metres from their cache.  
Hot and tired but much-relieved, they sank into what cover still remained, hoping that the few hours left until dark would be uneventful. And apart from one incident, when a hunter came wandering back, it was.  
The African was studying the ground intently and the men lying low in the bushes could not work out what he was doing until he bent down and picked up a rat the fire had killed. The hunting had obviously not been very successful.  
As it started to get dark, they began the night’s wore They had to ferry their ton of charges 400 metres to the river’s edge, as well as their boat, outboard motor, six canoes, petrol for the motor and personal equipment - and for a couple of hours they went back and forth humping everything down to the fiver.  
Even with 16 men sharing the work, they were tired enough to need a thirty-minute rest before assembling and loading the boats.  
The plan called for six canoes to carry two men each plus as much equipment as they could carry - and the boat with its outboard motor was to carry four men, plus the bulk of the explosives.  
It was midnight by the time they were ready to start upriver. It was the night of October 8 and according to their original timings, they should have been halfway to the bridges by now.  
The aerial photographic interpreters had told them that from the ripples on the river, they must expect a six-knot current. As the loss of the canoes had prevented the reconnaissance party being able to assess accurately the state of the river, they did not know for sure what the river was like.  
They were soon to find out.  
The current was very much against them and was far stronger than the six knots they had been anticipating. It was more like 15 knots. And just to make life interesting there were hippos, rocks and rapids in great abundance. Even the 15 horse-power (11 kilowatt) outboard motor on the inflatable Zodiac MK 111 boat, which was bringing up the rear, was severely strained in the rapids.  
The four freefallers were beginning to realise that even had they had the canoes for the reconnaissance, it would still have taken them four days to get to the target and back again. It had long ago dawned on them that the mission was not going to be as easy as they had originally thought First the loss of the canoes… then the long walk ... and now this. It was the final straw. But each man was confident that as long as they could negotiate the river, the mission was still on.  
The chaps in the canoes envied those in the boat because they were riding and not paddling… while the four men in the boat envied them for the relative ease with which they were manoeuvring their canoes through the rapids. Yet Bob McKenna and his team in the boat could guarantee they were having more problems than the canoeists.  
The boat was sitting very low in the water because of all the kit and explosives it was carrying… and Bob and his passengers kept being swept on to the sides of the river with the trees hanging over them and the propeller crashing on to the rocks.  
It was becoming apparent to all that their original time appreciation was far too ambitious and that they would not make the target by the next day. Instead, they were to spend the next couple of nights battling upriver in their overloaded craft And the days were spent lying low in what grass and vegetation there was in the gullies close to the river’s edge, and keeping out of the way of the locals living near the banks.  
As they struggled upriver, they seemed to be making no progress. So strong was the current and so fiercely were they battling against it that at times they thought they would never make it.  
At one set of rapids, the men in the boat lost control completely and were washed spinning and bouncing off the rocks for several hundred metres back downstream, nearly swamping in the process.  
Once more they tried negotiating the same set of rapids. Again they were unsuccessful.  
“Goodbye charge one and two,” Bob McKenna said at last, as 150 kilograms of explosives were heaved over the side of the boat.  
Bob was annoyed at having to jettison the explosives as it would mean that one less pier could be destroyed on the rail bridge. But he had no alternative; they had to get past the rapids if they wanted to reach the target.  
Fortunately, because they had brought more than enough explosives along they would still be able to destroy the centre pier on the rail bridge, the one it was essential to drop to render the bridge useless. Even without the jettisoned explosives, they barely made it past the rapids.  
Then another problem. One of the jerry cans containing fuel had somehow taken in water and when they hooked the jerry can on to the fuel pipe, water got into the carburettor and it stopped working completely.  
As Dave Dodson and the others in the six canoes battled through the night on their way upriver, Bob and his crew and the bulk of the explosives were being washed downstream. Eventually, they managed to paddle into the bank. but Bob and his team knew that if they could not get the motor going, they and the explosives would never reach the target and the op would have to be aborted.  
The commander meanwhile was continuing on his way, unaware of the latest crisis to befall the mission.  
Luckily, SAS men are versatile as well as determined, and NCO Vossy Vosloo was able to dissemble the motor by the light of a shielded flash-light, clean out the water and put the motor back together again. But it was only by draining the fuel off the top of the jerry can that they could gather enough to complete the journey.  
They were back in business, except now, they were ninety minutes behind the others. However they managed to catch up on their timings during that night’s journey.  
At last, on the night of the 10th, they neared the two bridges. They were close enough to hear trains rumbling over the Tazara rail bridge, and could hear road traffic travelling over the nearby road bridge.  
They found an exceptionally thick clump of trees just a few kilometres from the bridges and lay up for the day.  
Again and again they discussed exactly what they would have to do at the bridges. They went through their approach procedures… remembered they had to check for guards… discussed where they would place the charges… how they would go about capturing a vehicle for their escape.  
There were dozens and dozens of details and contingency plans to go over. Eventually they all knew what to expect and what to do should anything untoward happen.  
Darkness fell and the blackened-up men waited in the trees for a few hours. Then the 12 men in the six canoes finally set off for the bridges, leaving the motor boat party behind to follow later with the explosives.  
They planned to reach the bridge at about 22h00 to allow the locals plenty of time to get to sleep and the traffic time to diminish. They estimated the task would take about four hours.  
Two canoes went towards the riverbank where the four passengers were to check the area for police and guards. Two other canoes were to go fight up to the centre rail bridge pier and put a rope around it to enable the outboard motor party to hold the boat against the current while they laid their charges.  
The third couple of canoe teams were tasked to fix three hooks on to the centre pier to support the three 100 kilogram charges that the boat party would attach to them.  
Suddenly - dramatically - there was a single, brilliant almost supernatural flash of lightning. It lit up the entire area and illuminated the massive silver-painted girder rail bridge in every detail, giving the saboteurs still travelling towards it their first awe-inspiring glimpse of the target.  
To the soldiers, it was the most fantastic sight - a vivid picture burned into their eyeballs that they would remember long after other details of the mission had faded from their memories.  
To anyone who might have been around to watch, the Salisbury saboteurs were clearly visible, as if on a stage. But there was no reaction and the canoeists continued on their way.  
When the motor-boat party reached the bridge, they saw that the operators in the canoes had done their job exactly as they were meant to do. The centre pier had a rope around it and the hook points were ready and waiting for the charges.  
The boat party grabbed the rope and pulled the boat against the pier, then started to wrestle the first of the charges over the side on to its hook  
The three charges were attached to the hooks then eased below the water level, with the detonating cord leads remaining above the surface.  
Next, they had to tussle with the demolition net, the experimental explosive device which had to be placed on the opposite side of the pier to the three charges.  
It proved quite a battle weighting it, getting it down to its proper position flush against the pier, then having to anchor it in place against the current. But eventually the job was finished.  
They hooked up the _Cordtex_ leads from the three charges, leaving them to be connected later to the ringmain.  
Suddenly, their concentration was interrupted by the sound of firing on the riverbank. They listened intently, momentarily pausing in their tasks.  
Up on the bank, a policeman armed with a shotgun had appeared on the scene and challenged Phil Brooke and Frank Booth. Sadly, for him, his weapon was no match for the silenced AKs waiting for him, and although he managed to get away, he died in the bush.  
Commander Dave Dodson, meanwhile, sat on the bank under the railway bridge gathering reports from the various groups.  
His men were now climbing all over the two bridges positioning their many charges to ensure maximum destruction. Lieutenant Phil Brooke and his callsign, having finished their initial task of checking the area for police and guards, now turned their attention to sorting out the details for the great escape.  
Phil and his team had come prepared for setting up a roadblock, essential in the plan to hijack a vehicle to take them south. The roadblock team had done their homework and taken along exact duplicates of Zambian police and roadblock signs. And as planned, vehicles slowed as they approached the signs, stopped, then were waved on by the Rhodesians.  
There was a lot more traffic than they had anticipated and the roadblock party had got themselves quite a job, although they had not yet found the perfect get-away truck capable of carrying 16 men.  
There was now activity all over and under the bridges. Vehicles were being stopped and waved on; people were crawling over both bridges laying their charges; others were taking the boats apart. And the commander sat below by the radio accepting reports, checking everything was going as planned with the precision they had rehearsed so many times beforehand.  
Finally, the ringmain on the road bridge was hooked up and a lead was run down to join up with the rail bridge ringmain, ensuring that both bridges dropped simultaneously.  
Time was getting on and the commander told Phil Brooke to select a suitabk vehicle. Before long. traffic began piling up at the roadblock and at one time, six vehicles had come to a halt and Phil was frantically trying to signal them on.  
Finally, a twenty-ton chemical fertiliser truck came in sight and Phil knew it would be perfect for what they were planning.  
The truck stopped at the roadblock and the European driver and his black driver were taken into custody and the truck was pulled to the side of the road. Breakdown signs were hurriedly placed front and back, and the police roadblock signs were removed.  
They hoped that all subsequent traffic would see the breakdown signs and proceed without stopping. But events were not quite so straightforward.  
As soon as the breakdown signs were out, another truck drew alongside and insisted on helping,  
This driver, an Irishman, was also taken into custody and his truck pulled to the side of the road in front of the fertiliser truck.  
But the complications were not over yet.  
A truck that had already gone through the roadblock turned back 15 minutes later when the European driver suddenly realised that the fertiliser truck was not following him any more.  
Bob McKenna meanwhile, having finished helping with the explosives on the road bridge took a couple of men up top to see if they could help.  
They arrived to see two trucks pulled over and the two drivers and co-drivers in custody, the _other_ truck returning to the bridge - and a _fourth_ approaching from the opposite direction. Any minute now, there was going to be a traffic jam.  
As the driver of the fourth truck approached the bridge, he could see men carrying AKs. Realising that the situation called for discretion rather than valour, he was easily persuaded to go through the roadblock and pass on up the road.  
But the driver of the returning truck was not so easily convinced. He was adamant He was not going anywhere without the fertiliser truck and its driver.  
It was then that Phil Brooke and his team learned that both the trucks had been travelling in convoy - and that the drivers were brothers.  
The SAS had no way of knowing that because of the situation in Zambia at that time, it was the practise for truck drivers travelling in convoy to stop and help one another if one appeared to be having trouble with the police or bandits; or if there were more mundane problems like breakdowns.  
And try as they might, the soldiers could not convince the returning driver to continue of his way, so they had no choice but to take him into custody, too.  
There were, it turned out, only six European truck drivers in the whole of Zambia and the SAS had captured half of them.  
But yet another complication. In addition to the three white drivers and two co-drivers, they had got themselves another prisoner - a 10-year-old white boy.  
He was the nephew of one of the drivers and had been taken along for the ride as a special birthday treat. It proved to be a birthday like no other he was likely to have.  
He had little to say for himself but his eyes were like saucers, and the look on his face was one of pure excitement rather than fright.  
The white drivers, however, were not so thrilled with the turn of events that night. They were convinced they were going to be done away with.  
The African co-drivers, meanwhile, sat around and shrugged their shoulders and accepted the situation as if being detained by blackened-up armed Rhodesians was an everyday occurrence.  
Down under the bridge, the commander was furious.  
“What the _hell_ do you think you’re doing?” he demanded to know when he got the roadblock party’s progress report.  
He was certainly not expecting such a crowd of prisoners. They were all shepherded under the bridge near him, and while one man stood guard over them, the rest of the soldiers got on with their tasks.  
The group which had been dismantling the boat and canoes began carrying them up to the road… and the final charges were laid on the rail bridge, while up on the road bridge, the soldiers were turning their attention to the fertiliser truck.  
All the fertiliser bags in the centre of the open truck were jettisoned and the outside ones left nicely in place.  
Thus they shaped themselves a small fort, they could hide in the centre and make their getaway without being seen.  
While this was going on, several lorries drove over the bridge, accepted there was a breakdown of some sort and kept going. The soldiers had no trouble waving them through their little traffic jam, although there were a couple of times when they had to insist by gesticulating with the muzzles of their AKs.  
The commander, meanwhile, was trying to decide about the prisoners. It would cause all sorts of problems to take them back to Rhodesia, he knew. On the other hand, if he released them, they would lose no time raising the alarm. And with distance being the main consideration on this op, the SAS might well be located before they got to the border.  
His categoric order from ComOps was that it had to be a strictly clandestine mission. No one in Zambia must know who was responsible for blowing the bridges. But he realised the Zambians would have little trouble deciding where the blame lay.  
The SAS would simply have to take the prisoners with them and worry about the complications later. They probably would not be that keen but would be given some alternatives.  
Two men were now hooking up the final aspects of the ringmains on the bridges, while the prisoners, most of the SAS men, their canoes, boat, the motor and other bits and pieces were loaded into the centre of the fortified truce The back of the truck was fairly bristling with weapons.  
The two captured brothers climbed into the cab and one took up his position behind the wheel. Dave Dodson got in beside them with his silenced pistol and the brothers quickly got the message...  
The truck was moved to the southern end of the bridge ready for the getaway.  
All that remained was to light the fuses on the ringmain linking the two bridges.  
They had built in a 15-minute time delay, giving them long enough to get well clear of the bridges. They had tripled up on the initiation, so there was little chance of things going wrong.  
The initiation party lit the safety fuses and sprinted across from the northern side of the bridge to join the rest of their colleagues in the back of the truce.  
It was now 02h 15 and Dave Dodson ordered the driver to get a move on. The very nervous driver did exactly what he was told.  
The driver and his equally-worried brother kept asking the commander to assure them they would not be harmed.  
As long as they kept driving southwards, and fast, they would be safe, he told them.  
Then the driver began to worry about the fate of his truck, a precious item indeed, as trucks were virtually unobtainable in Zambia. It had cost him 48 000 Zambia kwacha, had under 10 000 kilometres (6 215 miles) on the clock, which for Africa was not much. It hadn’t been paid for, either.  
The driver’s brother, whose haulage truck was now parked near the road bridge, wondered if his truck would be blown up in the forthcoming blast.  
The SAS commander was purposely vague about the information he gave them and the other prisoners in case anything went wrong and they were recovered by the Zambian authorities.  
The two drivers and all on board remained tense as the truck sped southwards in the early morning. As they approached the little town o.f Chambeshi, the brothers, without much prompting told the SAS commander what lay ahead of them.  
The truce with its cargo of 16 heavily armed Rhodesian SAS men and six prisoners, drove into town.  
The brothers had warned of a little police station but there were no lights on at the station and no sign of life at all. They drove on and reached the outskirts of Chambeshi uneventfully.  
The SAS breathed slightly easier, while the two brothers continued to worry about their precious trucks.  
The little boy in the back still had eyes the size of saucers, as he ogled the blackened-up soldiers and their weapons. He was enjoying his unconventional birthday treat.  
Just to make him feel more at ease, Bob McKenna gave him some imported tinned chocolates he had been carrying around for years. He had brought them back from a trip to America and they were probably older than the boy himself.  
Twenty kilometres (12 miles) from the target, the driver was ordered to stop while a couple of men leapt from the back to cut the telephone wires from the bridges, the police station, and all points south.  
Just as they finished cutting the lines, they saw a huge orange flash, as their explosives went off… and soon the sound of the blast came rumbling across the Zambian countryside.  
The 16 soldiers were elated at their night’s work. The operation had been a big strain and they had worked so hard that when the big bang came they could hardly believe it It would have been a spectacular sight, they knew. Sadly, there could be no going back to check out the damage, for now time was short and the pressure was really on.  
They were well aware that some of the truck drivers who had already crossed the bridge may have reported the roadblock activities to other police stations on the way down south… and they still had Mpika to drive through before they could consider themselves even slightly safe.  
They had to get past that at least before daylight dawned.  
Their maps told them that the main road did not go through Mpika but was deviated around it. However, the mission commander was apprehensive about the accuracy of the maps, the state of the road, and whether they could pick the fight one.  
The soldiers in the back were alert and expecting trouble.  
Surely by now the word would have gone out about the events at the Chambeshi River a few hours earlier? As always, trigger fingers tightened on their AKs.  
Up front, the commander was learning all about Mpika from the driver. It had apparently developed into a railway repair workshop for the Tazara rail line, something the Rhodesian planners had not known. It was double the size the soldiers had thought it was.  
Luckily, the driver picked the by-pass road avoiding Mpika itself.  
Then it was a matter of trucking southwards, as far and as fast as they could, until it started getting light  
There was still a surprising amount of traffic on the road but none of the drivers gave any trouble. They had no way of knowing of course, that the ordinary-looking fertiliser truck hid six prisoners and sixteen alert soldiers who had just shattered Zambia’s economy.  
As daylight began to dawn, they started looking for dirt roads leading off the main road, so they could hide up somewhere for the day.  They hoped to find one just north of a town called Selenje, which would take them into the Luangwa National Park and south; and they found it just before sun-up.  
They stopped and changed drivers, and Bob McKenna climbed into the front to help the commander with the map-reading, It was getting light and the sun caught them driving through what was virtually a huge African tribal trust land.  
For ninety minutes they drove through the densely-populated area and were seen by thousands of locals.  
Dave Dodson and Bob McKenna were still blackened-up and did not know whether the locals suspected them or not. But the Zambians gave the lone fertiliser truck and the people in the cab a friendly wave and a smile as the travellers continued on their way.  
The Rhodesians waved back and commented how unbelievable it all was. Between the two of them, they worked out where they were and eventually made it in to the area of the national park.  
While they were heading southwards, Rhodesian Air Force Canberras were flying over Chambeshi to view the damage.  
A message flashed over the _Big Means_ to the operators inside their fort in the back of the feailiser truce “The bridges are jacked - they’re gone,” it said. Next to the explosion, that little message was one of the highlights of the mission. With one hundred percent success guaranteed, morale was extremely high.  
They had been driving down dirt roads for hours and were now fairly confident that without an intensive air effort they would not be spotted. But again they were wrong.  
As they drove over a hill, what should loom before them, right in the middle of a desolate wildlife area, but a large power station.  
The only good thing about it was that it had helped to confirm their location, but otherwise it spelt trouble. For, as with all power stations, there were bound to be guards.  
Immediately, they pulled off the road into a side track and stopped for a brew while Dave Dodson and Bob McKenna decided what to do.  
Now they had a dilemma. They had no idea how big the power station was or how many people were in it. If they were unable to kill everyone there, those who survived would undoubtedly give the alarm and the hunt would be on. Worse still their location would be known to Zambian security forces.  
Unbeknown to the SAS men, the power station guards had already spotted them, and while the soldiers were having their tea and deciding their next move, the guards had already climbed into their Land-Rover and were following up tracks.  
Towards 10h00, the soldiers and their prisoners heard the sound of a vehicle. They immediately deployed into an ambush position and waited.  
The Land-Rover came to a halt close to them and half a dozen uniformed Africans got out.  
A blackened-up SAS soldier called out to them, trying to beckon them forward with the idea of capturing them without too much trouble.  
But the guards decided that something was not quite right. They abandoned their Land-Rover and took to their heels as fast as they could. Those SAS who could, opened fire, and apart from two who got away, that was the end of the power station security guards.

Having made a fair amount of noise dispatching the guards, the SAS decided to pull out further from the area.  
They did not want to use the same road they had come in on, and, as the only other road wound down to the power station itself, Dodson and his men decided to drive southwards through the bush and escape a possible follow-up.  
They hid the guards’ Land-Rover in the bush and climbed back into the fertiliser truck. Dave Dodson and Bob McKenna told the owner of their new route. He was not impressed with the idea of bundu-bashing his new truck, not yet paid for.  
The two brothers had finally been convinced that they were not going to be killed but were now becoming more and more concerned about the fate of their trucks. One was abandoned back at the Chambeshi bridge - if it had not been destroyed in the blast - and the other was about to go bundu-bashing.  
It was ordered over rocks and through gullies. It knocked down trees and the driver had to take it places no sane person would take a Land-Rover, never mind a twenty ton truck.  
The anxious drivers wanted to know who was going to compensate them for their troubles. Would the insurance pay or who? The Zambians? The Rhodesians? Needless to say, the soldiers could not tell them.  
By late afternoon the terrain became too broken to continue any further. But by then they reckoned they had gone far enough.  
They were 200 kilometres (124 miles) from Rhodesia and within range of Rhodesian helicopters. The exhausted soldiers radioed for a pick-up but it was too late in the afternoon for the choppers to come that day. They would arrive at 08h00 on the 13th, they were told.  
They spent what was left of that afternoon cutting an LZ for the choppers, then took up their tactical positions, shared what little rations they had to spare among the prisoners, had a final brew, and finally went to sleep, posting their customary sentries.  
They were thoroughly exhausted after their many days of walking, battling upriver to the bridges, the job itself and their flight southwards. No one had any trouble sleeping that night.  
Next morning, they finished clearing the LZ with the help of the truck, and to the dismay of the unfortunate owner. But time was short and the trees huge. Meanwhile, the choppers flew from Salisbury to Mount Darwin, then to Musengezi Mission to refuel for the final part of their journey. They took on additional drums of fuel and during the flight northwards to collect the bridge saboteurs and their prisoners, fuel was pumped into the choppers from the drums, which were kicked to earth when empty.  
The moment the helicopters touched down, the prisoners suddenly became worried again. Despite all the assurances to the contrary, they felt that now the helicopters had arrived, the time had come to dispose of them.  
Much to their relief, the prisoners were all loaded on board. One driver bid farewell to his dust-covered and battered truck, pleased it was only his truck and not himself that was left to lie in the bush.  
Judging by the look on the boy’s face, he was still having the time of his life. He had become the best of friends with the soldiers and had never entertained any thoughts of being killed.  
They flew across the Luangwa River, over the Great East Road, then across into Mozambique, flying almost over where Macombe base camp had been before the waters of Lake Cabora Bassa had wiped it from their maps. Then it was across into Rhodesia, landing at Musengezi Mission, for refuelling.  
As they flew home, the SAS men thought about the mission. A lot had gone wrong, the op seemed jinxed at times, but the aim had been achieved.  
As they approached Kabrit Barracks, the prisoners were hooded to prevent them passing on information later about what they had seen.  
The operators had a quick debrief, got cleaned up and left for home, tired but satisfied at a job well done.  
As Bob McKenna loaded the prisoners into the truck for the last leg of their journey, one of the European brothers reached out and took his hand.  
“Shit, man! Thanks a lot for taking care of us,” he said. “If you’re ever in the area again, call in and have a few beers,” the grateful man added in all sincerity.  
The doors closed shut; the truck rolled out of Kabrit and the prisoners were taken to a _safe house_ outside Salisbury, where they became guests of Special Branch.  
They stayed at the secret house for many weeks and were given every comfort The boy even got a private tutor as he was missing so much schooling,  
Special Branch were worried that the Zambians would think the prisoners had taken part in the raid voluntarily and might kill or imprison them when they returned home.  
To complicate matters further, the boy’s mother was a British citizen. Thus his capture not only involved Rhodesia and Zambia, but internationalised the matter further, and so not to alarm his mother too much, word of his safety was flashed to her via the British Consulate in South Africa.  
After many lengthy negotiations, the British finally got guarantees for the prisoners’ safety and they were returned to Zambia. The Zambians, however, lost no time in imprisoning the captives. The boy was spared, but it would be a long time before he forgot his birthday adventure.  
Zambia would not forget the events of that night in a hurry either. Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda described the actions of that night as “economically crippling sabotage”.  
As a result, 18 000 tons of goods, including much-needed maize to make up the harvest shortfall and bound for Zambia were immediately stranded at Dar es Salaam.  
By severing Zambia’s lifeline to the Tanzanian port, the country’s copper exports and directly-related foreign exchange earnings were to suffer. At the time the SAS blew the bridges, there were already 10 000 tons of copper waiting to be shipped to world markets.  
The Works and Supply Minister, Mr Haswell Mwale, appealed to the country’s hard-pressed road haulage companies to help shift the stranded goods. But the scarcity of lorries compounded the problem and those few that did exist were fully committed.  
Observers believed that Zambia’s hopes for self-sufficiency in food production for the following year were destroyed with the bridges. Relief supplies of maize were needed because poor rains and late deliveries of fertiliser had stunted the previous year’s crop.  
Engineers estimated it would take about six months to rebuild the rail bridge and three to fix the road bridge. The Zambians said it would cost six million kwacha to repair the bridges and went with the begging bowl to the European Economic Community.  
Dropping the Chambeshi bridges had delivered Kenneth Kaunda’s head on a platter. He would now have no choice but to deal with the south and a regime he was committed to overthrow.
