Nkomo’s Russian advisers, who had convinced him to put his army on a much more conventional footing, had also been turning their attention to ZIPRA’s intelligence department, the Department of National Security and Order (NSO) and were unimpressed by what they found.
The Soviets were highly critical of the NSO’s operations and considered them to be totally ineffective. ZIPRA was told they could not hope for any success unless they developed an accurate intelligence picture.
Nkomo listened to his Russian friends once more and the NSO was given a complete overhaul. As a direct result of the Soviet’s influence, the department was expected to produce much more tangible results, which were in turn expected to improve ZIPRA’s overall effectiveness.
Several agents were subsequently infiltrated into Rhodesia, including two women with British passports who travelled via Botswana. Ten other women were sent to Kitwe in Zambia for counter-intelligence duties before travelling to Botswana “refugee” camps acting as “screeners” to vet potential insurgents and seek out Rhodesian Special Branch spies.
The NSO began training their own military and civil police and the first civil courses were held at the Zambian training school while military courses were held in East Germany and Russia.
The NSO intelligence officers took their duties very seriously and were hated by the ZIPRA rank and file. They saw spies behind every tree and anyone suspected of treachery was severely beaten, even tortured.
The men running the NSO had all been trained by the KGB in Moscow... and the man in charge, Dumiso Dabengwa, was allegedly a KGB colonel.
Dabengwa, the second most important person in ZIPRA, was a personal confidante of Joshua Nkomo, briefing _The Fat Man_ daily when he was in Lusaka. He even described himself as “Rhodesia’s Public Enemy No. 2.”
Dabengwa received his orders directly from Nkomo and was kept aware of all military operations, planning and strategy being undertaken by ZIPRA.
He ran a number of agents throughout the globe, including some whites in Europe.
Assistant Director of Intelligence Victor Mlambo also employed a number of white agents in Zambia, as well as members of communist agencies in the UK.
ZIPRA’s overseas representatives based in external offices around the world sent their intelligence to NSO, which also worked closely with the intelligence department of the South African ANC, also said to have a number of influential European sympathisers.
There was liaison with Soviet and East German intelligence, and NSO was in constant contact with its own ZIPRA intelligence agents in training in Russia.
Five of the top people in the ZIPRA intelligence organisation not only worked but slept at the NSO headquarters, which housed material of immense importance. All the files, including top secret documents detailing agents and their operations, as well as ZIPRA’s military operations, were kept there. Plans for urban operations and reports from the war front were filed there, too.
Thus all the intelligence vital to ZIPRA’s war effort, and all the people in on the secrets, were concentrated under one roof.
From an intelligence point of view, it was clearly the most important ZIPRA building in Zambia ... and the hierarchy kept the whereabouts of the headquarters a closely-guarded secret.
It was called _The Vatican_ ... a holy place because no one but key personnel was allowed in.
So important was it that the entrance was kept padlocked and the main gate was hidden from prying eyes by a hessian screen. The entire complex was surrounded by a two-metre high security fence, which was topped with three-strand barbed wire. There was also a guard system.
The ZIPRA capture _The Black Swine,_ who had proved such a useful source of intelligence to the Rhodesians, had put SB in the picture about _The Vatican_. “Hey, why don’t we go and take the NSO out?” he had suggested one day.
It was the first SB had heard of the place, and now they were in on the secret it was essential that action be taken.
But first they had to pinpoint _The Vatican_. Initially, all _The Black Swine_ could remember was that it was in the middle of an exclusive residential area in the north of the Zambian capital where overseas diplomats and ambassadors had their official residences.
To make matters worse, it had been many months since he had been to _The Vatican_ and anything might have happened in the interim. The place might have changed beyond all recognition. The NSO might even have been moved.
Many fruitless hours were spent poring over all the available maps and aerial photgraphs of Lusaka. Then, one day as he was driving an SB officer home, _The Black Swine_ remembered that the NSO was in Lutuba Road, Roma Township, ten kilometres (six miles) to the north-east of the city centre.
And that was that. Another dramatic raid was about to take place. The Rhodesians were breaking all the rules… the intelligence, the maps and the photographs were all old.
Any other country would have insisted on up-to-the-minute intelligence before contemplating such an operation so far from home.
But on the importance of the place alone, it was decided to mount an extremely daring raid to take out the headquarters. Once again it would mean going 200 kilometres (124 miles) into the heart of the Zambian capital with all the attendant risks.
Such a mission, far from home with an army, air force, SAM-7 and even Rapier threat, was fraught with danger. A thousand things could go wrong.
Perhaps the Zambians would be quicker to react than they had been during the Easter raid into their capital? They certainly ought to be more on their toes.
The plan was to surround the headquarters and take the intelligence VIPs by surprise. They would then fight their way into the intelligence HQ neutralising all resistance.
Then, using a loud hailer, _The Black Swine_ would call out to the ZIPRA hierarchy and get them to surrender.
The first prize was to capture alive the elusive Dumiso Dabengwa, head of the NSO. Second prize was Victor Mlambo, assistant director of intelligence, and third prize, Gordon Butshe, assistant director of counter intelligence and security.
The Rhodesians were hoping against hope that they would be able to take home all three. It was strongly felt that given the chance, they would all surrender.
If they did not, they would have to be eliminated.
Either way, the inter-city raiders would not be returning home empty-handed.
They planned to recover all the important intelligence documents and top secret records obtainable.
The entire complex was to be set alight and destroyed… and they would be off and away before the terrorists knew what had hit them, and before the element of surprise had been lost.
It would involve being on the ground for some considerable time... long enough for the MiGs to be scrambled and the Zambian Army to react. Speed would be of the essence.
The mission, codenamed Operation _Carpet_ was given to “C” Squadron. the squadron that had carried out the daring Operation _Bastille_ on Nkomo’s house. “C” squadron commander. Captain Martin Pearse, was to be the tactical commander, and the CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett, was to be the overall ground commander.
Once again, the all-important method of entry into the heart of Lusaka was examined and Martin drew up a long list of possibilities.
Should they use a pantechnicon? During Operation _Bastille,_ Martin had noticed pantechnicons parked along the outskirts of Lusaka and it was obvious that no one would give them a second thought. Perhaps they could parachute in, take motor bikes with them, meet a pantechnicon driven by an agent, park the truck in Lusaka, travel to the target on motor bikes, then afterwards, put them back in the truck and drive out of town?
Perhaps they could hijack private transport... or perhaps try the Sabre trick again? An agent parked nearby in a truck could provide back-up support; then again, maybe the helicopters could pick them up after the raid?
While the headquarters was bang in the middle of a residential suburb, it did have in its favour the fact that it was on flat ground and was on an isolated plot with vacant one-acre plots on two sides. And in the end, it was decided that if it was feasible, the troops would be ferried in four Bell 205 helicopters, putting them down fight next to the security fence.
The Bells would be ideal. The longhaul helicopters meant that targets once out of helicopter range were now accessible. Lusaka was now a mere two-hour hop from the border.
And the far larger load capacity of the Bells greatly assisted external operations as they could carry almost four times the load of the Alouettes.
Squadron Leader Ted Lunt, a much-admired pilot and the OC of 8 Squadron, the Bell Squadron, received a telephone call a few weeks before the operation was mounted, asking him to pop over to Kabrit to chat to SAS CO Garth Barrett and the lads as they had a few questions they wanted to put to him.
Asked if it was feasible to land troops with total surprise at first light in Roma suburb, the squadron leader said that whilst it could be done. he very much doubted ComOps, let alone the commander of the Air Force, would sanction such a hazardous raid, as the chance of losing fifty percent of their air effort seemed pretty good.
A chorus of voices assured him it had already been cleared and it merely needed 8 Squadron’s approval as far as feasibility was concerned. Getting the SAS in undetected and safely out was 8 Squadron’s problem: sorting out the ZIPRA intelligence headquarters was to be Martin Pearse’s baby.
The squadron leader’s orders were clear and simple - drop about 28 SAS at the given address, give them as much time on the ground as possible, pick them up again and get out safely to Rhodesia.
Total secrecy was clamped on the plan and for the next few weeks he pored over maps and stereo photographs deciding on the best routes in and out. He also had to plan the fuel requirements, which were critical on that operation, as the maximum load of men and equipment was to be carded by each of the four 205s that were to make the trip to Lusaka.
The problems facing the squadron leader and the men of 8 Squadron were enormous. They had to get in to Zambia under radar... and they had to avoid villages and terrorist camps that might raise the alarm.
For the squadron leader, the most worrying of all was leading in a formation in the dark with aircraft navigation lights off and having to fly at the lowest height above the ground they dared. He decided they would fly between 400 and 700 feet.
The plan was to put in an air strike on FC camp shortly before the raid on the NSO as a diversionary measure to draw attention away from Lusaka in the hope that the Zambian army and air force would rush up there, FC camp which had been bombed the previous October, now only housed a caretaker element.
Then, while everyone was scurrying to FC. the assault on the NSO would get under way, it was hoped that the noise from the camp attack would cover the approach of the noisy Bells and the attack on the intelligence headquarters.
Captain Martin Pearse, the tactical commander, had to cover every possible eventuality the SAS men on the ground would face... and once again he drew up a meticulous set of orders.
The first inkling the “C” Squadron men had that something was afoot was when reconnaissance parties were sent out to find an isolated spot and an old house where they could rehearse their all-important house-clearing drills.
It was like Operation _Bastille_ all over again, they agreed... and they knew they were on to something similar.
The reconnaissance parties chose an old farmhouse some fifty kilometres (thirty miles) from Salisbury. It was on a long peninsular jutting out into Darwendale Dam and was fenced on one side. It was in the centre of a game area and more than met the requirements of being in a very secluded spot.
The area fell under the jurisdiction of National Parks Board officer Stu Hulley-Miller, who, when on call-up, was the SAS/SB liaison man. He had planned to demolish the old brick and mud farm buildings and tobacco barns anyway, so the SAS chaps would be doing him a favour.
The whole of “C” Squadron deployed to the dam, the exact mission still shrouded in secrecy.
After a couple of days of sorting out their kit, Martin gave them a full briefing and told them exactly what the task was to be.
Once again, they found it hard to believe they would be attacking a target right in the heart of Lusaka, and were more than a little amazed that they would be doing it soon after their first visit.
Every effort was to be made to attain the mission’s objective, the commander stressed.
There were five offices in two office blocks at NSO, a storeroom and an underground bunker, believed to be used for the safe-keeping of important documents rather than people.
The four-bedroomed house had bars on all the windows and there would be about eight guards who were expected to react aggressively to an attack, Martin told the men.
They split into small teams and were allocated their tasks. Three groups would fight their way into the intelligence headquarters, while two external security groups would take up defensive positions and make sure there was no interference from other enemy elements.
Working on the aerial photographs and a sketch supplied by _The Black Swine_, they virtually mapped out the entire NSO on the ground.
A week of very intensive rehearsals followed during which they perfected their technique of breaching the walls, getting into the building calling the terrorists out and. in the event Of their not coming, planning how they would go in and get them.
Using as a basis a British Army system of room-to-room fighting techniques, the SAS had come up with their own version, simplified here and there with short cuts evolved from various types of operations and aided by a variety of home-grown weapons.
For training, an assortment of targets would be placed inside an empty building which was sandbagged at the windows... someone would shoot to simulate fire coming down... four men would rush up to the house and take on the various targets; one man would throw a grenade in and move up to the door.
As the grenade went in, another man would move to the door and fire into the comer of the room. Another would move in, firing to light the place, firing low into comers, into cupboards, under beds and all the places where the enemy could be expected to hide.
The number two man then moved into the room and covered the first man who moved to a point where he could dominate the whole room. He would switch on the torch strapped to the underside of his AK and finish clearing the room.
The stone wall surrounding the NSO complex was to be breached in three places with a Rhodesian-manufactured charge known as _The Hulk_, which contained five kilograms of explosives, enough to blow a man-sized hole in the wall enabling the operators to get through to their target.
_The Hulks_ were potent and had a twenty-second fuse on them, long enough for the soldiers to get clear before the damage was done.
After that, the rooms were to be bunker bombed. Martin Pearse was to throw in his bunker bomb first to initiate the house attack.
The bunker bomb concept was gone into at length during their rehearsals and they worked on the principle that, if possible, they needed to get two walls between the bomb and the operator. For the bombs were so powerful there was a very real possibility of the walls caving in.
Martin and Lieutenant Rich Stannard who was to be the 21C on the operation were to command two of the assault groups and they had many discussions about the bunker bomb procedure. Martin was uncertain about what he would do once he had thrown in his bunker bomb. He could not decide if he was going to move right away from the wall and around to the other side of the building... or crouch down underneath it... or move back and then crouch down. Rich said he had definitely decided to move right away.
SB representatives Stu Hulley-Miller and John Grey had got the sketch of the NSO lay-out from _The Black Swine_ and showed it to the SAS.
“Fine! But what are those, there? Are they windows? If not, what are they? And arc there burglar screens on them?” the soldiers queried.
“What’s the door like in the office? In the living quarters? What’s the design of the cupboard and the cabinets in the office? Is there a spare ammo magazine anywhere?”
The SAS wanted to know every possible detail. Fortunately _The Black Swine_ had a good memory and was able to explain where everything was to the best of his knowledge, giving them the inside story.
Martin went over and over the plan with his troops using air photographs and the model of the NSO. Nothing was left to chance. Every man knew his role inside out. There were to be 24 men involved in the target area; some on the actual house attack, the others in defensive positions around the NSO.
The pilots practised the run-in to the NSO, the soldiers rehearsed deplaning as the choppers came in to land ... the sequence of events ... which callsigns were to go where ... the action on the prisoners-of-war they hoped to get ... what _The Black Swine_ was to say over the loud hailer... where the two stop groups would be positioned to prevent civilians and the Zambian army approaching the target... practised getting back in to the choppers for the lift off.
It was to be an open Rhodesian raid. There would be no blackening-up. Normal Rhodesian camouflage and steel helmets were to be worn.
Even the tame terrorist, _The Black Swine_, was to be dressed in Rhodesian camouflage and issued with a weapon to help out. AKs, lighter, easier to wield in confined spaces and with a larger magazine capacity than the FN, were to be carried.
SB officer John Grey was to go to the NSO to escort _The Black Swine_ and to help the former terrorist round up captures and interrogate them.
The Quartermaster, Major Paul Simmons, had organised the manufacture of huge sausage-shaped bags, made from canvas mattress covers. These were to be used to carry the wealth of important documents they hoped to capture.
The Special Branch men had to delve into the coffers of their secret money to buy satchels for the operators to carry the bunker bombs. On ops such as this, it was essential that there was no _cuffing_, as they said in army circles... it was essential that every man had precisely the pouches and aids he needed.
Plastic handcuffs and black hoods for the prisoners were also on their shopping list.
While some operators searched for the VIP prisoners and others cleared the offices of their paper work, others had been tasked to hunt for the underground bunker which housed a safe containing top secret papers plus some thirty thousand dollars in foreign currency.
Luckily, the squadron had among its ranks the services of a TA soldier who earned his living in civvy street as a locksmith. Les Clark had done his homework well and reckoned he would be able to pick the lock within 15 seconds.
If, for some reason, he was not able to do that, they were going to blow it open... and if that didn’t work, they planned to pull it out with a chopper.
But Les and Stu Hulley-Miller were unable to find anyone who could tell them the secret of blowing a safe effectively. Other special forces who had done it had usually gone for overkill, destroying not only the safe, but the contents as well.
In order to become safe burglars, they really needed the help of a safe expert, but could hardly walk into a shop and ask for help.
Stu chose a likely candidate, checked him out - where he lived, his background, connections, his politics - then made his approach.
Flashing his SB identity card, but omitting any mention of an SAS connection, Stu explained he had to get documents out of a safe. After verifying _his_ credentials, the man agreed to help, and provided them with some safes to practise on... and they eventually got their safe-cracking technique down to a fine art.
Using _Knock-Knock_ charges, they were able to blow the lock off without destroying the safe. After that, it was merely a matter of turning the handle.
Finally the exhaustive rehearsals, the best the “C’” Squadron operators had undertaken, were over. On the afternoon of June 25, they all moved out to Makuti airfield on the Rhodesian side of the Zambezi in readiness for the flight to Lusaka.
It was clear from things Martin said in private to some of his men that he had an uneasy feeling about the operation.
The raid was being launched early on Tuesday morning, before the NSO guards and the Zambian army were up and about and when the reaction time would be slow.
Three days later, Martin was to be presented with his Silver Cross of Rhodesia, the country’s second highest gallantry honour, to be awarded, in part, for his role on Operation Bastille
The night before they lifted off for Lusaka, he had a quiet word with SB officer John Grey: “Wouldn’t it be funny if I copped it before I got my medal?” he said` He had already spoken to medic Sergeant Major Bruce Langley under the shade of a bluegum tree at Darwendale. Hitting his trouser pocket, Martin told him: “There’s my medical kit. [f I get shot...’”
That night they all slept on the airstrip underneath the choppers. John Grey for one was not getting much sleep though.
“What’s the matter?.” _The Black Swine_ enquired. “Can’t you sleep?” “No - Fm too worried,” John confided. “What if we’ve got the wrong place after all?”
“It’ll be all right man, I’m telling you,” _The Black Swine_ assured him, “Okay, so it might have changed a bit, but I know I’ve got the right place.”
John felt a bit better after that; but he still lay awake all night.
At last D-day dawned. It was June 26. The choppers had already refuelled. At 04h00, the men were shaken awake. They donned normal Rhodesian camouflage as well as balaclavas and thick jerseys, and carried gloves for later.
Apart from the command chopper, none of the others had doors and without warm clothing they would have been just too cold to move once at the target.
They had a quick cup of tea, and Martin once again ran through his orders.
“Remember,” he briefed his team. “This thing is like a race... if anything goes wrong... If I go... the race carries on.”
Just before they left he confided in Lieutenant Rich Stannard, “You know Rich,” he said, “I’m still very worded about this bunker bomb.” Martin was still undecided about where exactly he would move to while waiting for the powerful bomb to go off.
In Salisbury, Air Commodore Norman Walsh and SAS Major Dave Dodson were preparing to board the command Dakota to fly straight to the target. In Thornhill air base, Gwelo, four Hunter pilots were readying themselves to fly out and drop their deadly golf bombs on FC camp. Two other Hunters, armed with air-to-air missiles, were going to act as top cover.
Then, towards 05h00, the 24 operators, pilots and crews climbed aboard the choppers and in the darkness took their leave of Makuti. Soon they had overflown the Zambezi and were en route for Lusaka.
It was going to be a very significant raid in more ways than one. Not only was it going to strike at the nerve centre of ZIPRA’s intelligence centre, but the air and ground forces were to launch their attack only hours before Bishop Abel Muzorewa’s black-dominated coalition government of national unity took power.
It would show ZIPRA and the world that Muzorewa, who was also Minister of Defence, meant business. He had already warned that the advent of black rule did not mean that cross-border military raids would stop if there was a threat to the nation’s security.
The SAS were feeling extremely confident. Their intelligence was the best that was possible. The rehearsals had been exhaustive and they could not have been more prepared. They knew much more about the NSO than they had known about Nkomo’s house.
It was to take the Bell 205s about one hour 45 minutes to get to the target and the route was from Makuti, across the Zambezi, well east of Lusaka to a point about fifty kilometres (thirty miles) north-east of Lusaka. Then, they were to fly across to the west of the railway line towards the vicinity of FC terrorist camp, just north of Lusaka, where the diversionary strike was to be put in by jets.
After that, their route would take them south to the outskirts of Lusaka, where it was thought the clatter of the Bells might be mistaken for diesel trains.
Squadron Leader Lunt who had the unenviable task of navigating the way through the darkness, would then look for a landmark - a school - from where they would run in and land at the NSO.
Navigation was purely on time and heading basis. The squadron leader had planned his route and timings precisely, working out how long they would travel in one direction before changing course.
When the pilots lifted off from Makuti it was pitch black and they could see absolutely nothing outside the perspex windows of the Bells.
The helicopters had to get to the target at the crack of dawn well before the five VIPs and eight guards in the NSO were awake. The attack was due to go in at 06h15.
It was still dark as the choppers began their approach to the Zambian capital and the early morning air cut keenly through the operators’ uniforms and jerseys.
At first light, the helicopters descended to treetop level and tightened formation. Winds had given them problems but it was only by the grey of first light that they realised they were more north than planned. They could not pull up higher either for fear of being picked up by radar at Lusaka.
The pilots turned back towards the capital and were veering around trying to spot landmarks.
Time was running out. Fuel was getting low. It was getting lighter by the minute.
Inside the Bells, the tension was mounting. They had to be getting near the target by now surely?
Squadron Leader Lunt asked Air Commodore Norman Walsh and Major Dave Dodson on board the command Dakota and flying in Zambian airspace for the Hunters to put their strike in early to help them pinpoint FC camp.
He dare not move the formation south too early, for if they overflew the camp in error, the entire formation would be shot down.
Norman Walsh and Dave Dodson discussed the plan and it was decided to put the strike in only if the troops were going to have a reasonable amount of time at the target.
By now, it was fairly light and squadron leader Lunt had picked up his bearings. He gave a revised time over the target It was almost twenty minutes later than originally planned.
The fuel situation was serious, affecting the flying time back to the border, but Squadron Leader Lunt suggested that the op go ahead. They would be able to give the operators extra time at the target if he could call forward the air force’s one and only standby 205 with fuel to a position on the Zambezi. Alternatively, they had a Dakota already airborne with six fuel drums on board and they could be parachuted to them in the bush.
The original plan had been for the choppers to orbit an area away from the target while the SAS were busy with the NSO, but to conserve fuel, it was decided the choppers would sit on the ground instead with their engines idle.
The SAS would have only about forty minutes at the target and ground commander Garth Barrett radioed across to Martin Pearse’s chopper to stress the strict time limitation and ask if he could still do the job. Martin, keen for the mission to continue, said it would be no problem.
The squadron leader radioed the hierarchy in the Dakota that the SAS and pilots wished to go ahead with the raid and that they were confident the task could be done.
Major Dodson and the air commodore agreed and the Bells flew straight to the target, the jet strike being put in on FC five minutes before their arrival at the NSO.
The limited time span meant the troops did not have the luxury of doing a quick assessment and sifting out what paperwork was of no use to them and what was essential. They would have to get into the house, kidnap the prisoners, find the underground bunker and bring out every piece of paperwork they came upon.
It was no longer a first light attack The raid was to go in in broad daylight.
Amazingly, the local Zambian population waved at the Rhodesians in the Bells. The choppers were flying straight to the target in the elite Roma township. There was not one manicured lawn to be seen. Every one was unkempt and neglected.
The Bells came in low over an African school, just as planned. The soldiers readied themselves, firmly gripping their AKs. The atmosphere was electric. The SAS gunners positioned by the open doors prepared to go into action the moment they touched down or even before if the circumstances called for it. The doors of the command chopper were opened as they came in to land.
The Rhodesians could clearly see the vacant plots by the side of the NSO complex.
As they came down they could see that the NSO had changed considerably since their aerial photographs had been taken.
There was now a completely new office block, something they had not catered for in their clearance drills.
There were machineguns mounted outside the walls; also not anticipated. Fortunately, the gunners, although at their posts that morning, possibly thought that the choppers belonged to the Zambian Air Force and as a result did not react. It was a lucky break for the attackers - the ZIPRA gunners could have exacted a heavy toll on the very vulnerable Rhodesians and their precious aircraft.
The armed guards, alerted by the racket from the Bell engines, began to spill into the courtyard. Others, who had been sleeping along the perimeter fence, took up their positions. There were some 24 altogether, three times more than the visitors had been expecting.
The Bells were committed to landing among them and a tremendous hail of bullets met the descending choppers. The Rhodesians opened up. The choppers were orientated at just the right angle to give the Rhodesian machinegunners full view of the building and they were firing as they came in to land. They had obviously succeeded with the surprise aspect of the mission.
The enemy guards were being killed even before the SAS had touched down.
A lone terrorist ran up an anthill on the outside of the building and opened up on them with a light machinegun. He aimed at the command chopper carrying CO Garth Barrett, John Grey, Lieutenant Stan Hornby, two medics and _The Black Swine_ and a round smashed into the perspex bubble right next to the pilot’s head.
Then before the terrorist could do any more damage, his weapon jammed. It was another lucky break for the Rhodesians for they would certainly have lost the chopper and possibly the passengers had he continued firing.
The pilot virtually landed on top of the terrorist, but at the last moment, the man managed to duck away and flee down the hill.
“’THERE HE IS,” _The Black Swine_ bellowed above the noise from the engine and the sporadic firing,
Quickly, Garth Barrett and John Grey leapt out of the chopper and killed the terrorist and then his partner, who had joined him to man the light machinegun.
The choppers landed in the vacant plots next to the NSO. It was 06h38. The initial resistance had been swiftly neutralised and there was virtually no firing as everyone leapt out into his correct position.
The choppers reported to the command Dak that the situation was looking good.
The choppers immediately lifted off to a holding area in the bush just seven minutes flying time away to refuel from the drums they were carrying, They could not go further out because of the shortage of fuel. They shut down their rotors and the aircraft were throttled back to idle, ready to lift off at a moment’s notice to extract the troops, either at the conclusion of their mission or in the event of an early Zambian reaction.
The CO, Garth Barrett, had taken up his position in one of the vacant plots with the two medics and Lieutenant Stan Hornby who was to man the 60 millimetre mortar and provide protection. Barrett was to be in constant radio communication with the groups assaulting the house, all other groups, and the command Dakota.
The Command Dakota meanwhile had the task of monitoring Zambian army, air force and police networks and passing the word of any Zambian reaction to the CO.
The troops had no sooner disemplaned than they heard a wailing sound exactly like the frenzied shrieking before a charge. But it was nothing more serious than the ululating rantings of the high school children, just one block away from the firing and highly agitated at the sight of the Rhodesian choppers.
Three callsigns - Martin Pearse’s, Rich Stannard’s and Mike Barlow’s - took up their positions on three sides of the security wall in readiness to detonate their Hulks and blast their way through the two-metre-high walls.
Another callsign had already made their way to the front entrance to keep it covered from any escaping guards once the house attack went in, and to protect the assault force from any outside interference.
Two others, one under the command of _Jungle Jordan_ and the other commanded by _Petrol Paul_ deployed to the two approach roads to provide early warning of any interference, to keep innocent civilians away, and to take on any hostile intruders.
_The Black Swine_ the former top ZIPRA official, stood guard outside _The Vatican_ waiting to call on his former colleagues to hand themselves over to the Rhodesians.
Quickly, the three men tasked to place the _Hulk_ charges ran to the walls, stuck them in position and lit the fuses, swiftly taking cover from the impending explosion that would blast an entrance into the ZIPRA Holy of Holies.
All three breaching charges were to go off simultaneously, but only Martin Pearse’s blew. They had taken the necessary precautions and kept them covered during the night but perhaps the early-morning dew had affected the igniter mechanisms. Still it did not really matter now, the pressure was on and they had to get inside the courtyard.
Rich Stannard and his team sprinted around to the front entrance. They slapped a _Gatecrasher_ charge on the padlocked main gate, stood back and blew the lock off. Rich and his team of three men hurried through.
By now, Martin Pearse’s callsign had already got through the breach in the back entry route.
Mike Barlow in charge of the third assault group got his team together and they ran down to Martin’s entrance.
The back entry route was lined with trees giving them a bit of cover from the building As they stepped through the back breach, sporadic firing came from inside the courtyard. Guards were running everywhere but they were more intent in putting as much space between themselves and the visitors than trying to defend the place.
The Rhodesians quickly overcame what resistance there was and a dozen guards soon lay dead in the courtyard. Another was killed on the main road.
In the process, the raiders had taken a casualty of their own. A ricochet from a machinegun hit a corporal in the back and lodged in his stomach.
Martin Pearse grabbed him and heaved him outside the breached wall and the troops waiting there hurried him straight to the medical team.
Up the road, _Jungle Jordan_ was having a small problem with one of the guards who was armed with an RPD. But the ZIPRA man was soon killed and the RPD silenced.
Inside _The Vatican_ courtyard, the teams moved in.
Rich Stannard went to the side of the house near a verandah to throw in his bunker bomb and Martin Pearse moved to the side of the building to place his bomb in the guard’s room.
The plan called for Martin to put his bunker bomb in first. He would then give a quick blast on his dog whistle, which was the signal for Rich and his entry team to throw in their bunker bomb at their side of the house. They would then move in and begin their house-clearing exercise.
The window in the guard’s room was covered in mesh which meant that Martin had to feel his bunker bomb in rather than hurl it in, as he normally would have done.
The commander put the bunker bomb in, moved fight back and around the side of the house and crouched down.
The bomb exploded... The SAS men in position around _The Vatican_ saw the asbestos roof lift off.
Then ... silence, and a sudden lull. Rich Stannard was patiently waiting for the whistle to signal the start of his bunker bombing and house-clearing phase at the front of the house.
“Callsign 39... What’s happening?” queried Garth Barrett, the overall commander on the radio from the outside of the wall. There was no reply.
Rich Stannard was getting worried. “’HAVE YOU SEEN CAPTAIN PEARSE?” he shouted to one man. The soldier said he had not.
Rich decided to find out what was happening.
Abandoning his own task for the moment, he took the other three men in his callsign and raced around to the back of the building and into the dust and mess to investigate. Martin was nowhere to be seen.
The devastating picture that met Rich clearly told what had happened. The bunker bomb, instead of simply destroying the room had not only brought down the entire side of the house where the bomb had been thrown, but the other wall too behind which Martin was crouching for protection. Although Martin had followed their rehearsals to the letter, such was the inferior quality of the building that it had not been able to withstand the force of such an explosion.
“START DIGGING!” Rich yelled to the soldiers.
The huge chunks of concrete were quickly heaved out of the way. Clouds of dust and smoke hung in the air.
It was a race against time. If Martin was under that lot, they had to get him out fast.
They dug deeper and deeper. Still they found no trace. Then, someone spotted Martin’s radio aerial, then his helmet.
Martin’s lifeless body was eased from the rubble. His premonition of disaster had not been unfounded after all.
Rich immediately radioed Garth Barrett at the command post and told him what had happened.
“Carry on as planned,” came the order.
It was as Martin would have wished. The race, as he had called it, was continuing ... He was carried out through the breach in the wall and handed over to the medics.
The delay meant there was now no time for _The Black Swine_ to call out the NSO hierarchy. They would just have to go in and get them.
Rich Stannard’s team returned to the front of the building. Rich heaved in their bunker bomb and ran around the corner to take cover. Their bomb blew a huge hole in the dining room taking away the entire outer verandah in the process.
Even before the belching clouds of dust and smoke had settled, the four-man assault team had moved inside. They had no opposition. Swiftly, they set about clearing the house and searching for the VIPs. Aided by the torches strapped to their AKs, they fired under beds, into cupboards, anywhere ZIPRA’s top men were likely to be hiding.
Ricochets and chippings screamed in all directions, as one by one the rooms were swiftly dealt with. But there was no sign of the top three ZIPRA intelligence men.
Only Dumiso Dabengwa’s clothes, his diaries, leather case and pigskin briefcase.
A Danish Embassy official living opposite stuck his head out of the window and began taking pictures of the breakfast-time raid. Someone sent a quick burst in his general direction and his curiosity suddenly waned. He quickly disappeared behind a wail, never to be seen again.
Inside the house and the nearby office blocks, the SAS were ransacking the place.
All the drawers, briefcases, cupboards and files were emptied. Every scrap of paper was being bundled into the huge sausage-shaped bags. There were thousands of papers, a good two tons of the stuff.
When the troops had finished with one building they tossed in a bunker bomb to destroy it.
The callsign tasked to get into the underground bunker and break into the top secret safe were having no luck. They just could not find the place. They knew where it ought to be; the only trouble was the new office block had been built over it and they did not know where to start looking for the entrance hole.
_Petrol Paul’s_ road block group guarding one of the access routes to _The Vatican_ could see a group of civilians gathering on a slight rise up the road.
The Zambians seemed fascinated by all the noise from the bunker bombing and grenades, but their curiosity never extended to moving down their hill for a closer look.
Then a Peugeot car roared down the road, passing the swelling crowd of interested onlookers. When it got to within 200 metres of the road block group, it screamed to a halt and the driver and passengers, all dressed in civilian clothes, leapt out.
￼![317 - Carpet](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/317%20-%20Carpet.png)
The soldiers distinctly saw one man clutching an AK climb out of the driver’s seat and, thinking they were either terrorists or special branch, they opened fire on them.
The men fled into the bush in all directions fearing for their lives.
After the war, SB officer John Grey learned that one of the men was Victor Mlambo, NSO assistant director of intelligence, who had been on his way to work.
The soldiers fired a couple of rockets at the car to destroy it and discourage anyone else trying to get any closer. The choppers still had to return and collect them and they didn’t want anyone getting too close before then.
Rich Stannard and crew, having finished with the house, which was now a burning crackling ruin, turned their attention to the two brand-new Peugeot cars in the parking bay. They put Knock-Knock charges on the engine blocks, then threw in phosphorus grenades to finish them off.
_Jungle Jordan_ meanwhile, out on the road, managed to grab an African scuttling away from the intelligence headquarters.
“’No, no,” the man insisted,”I’m not a bad boy boss, honest. I’m only the garden boy from next door,” he wailed.
But _Jungle Jordan_ was not convinced and the rather worded-looking man was escorted to the command post and kept under guard.
Inside the office blocks, there was still much frenzied activity. There were mountains of documents, far more than they expected and the soldiers continued stuffing it into the sacks. But still no sign of the underground bunker.
But time was going and the pressure was on. There was a possible Zambian air force reaction to consider. The eavesdroppers in the command Dak orbiting Lusaka had already picked up the start of a reaction and the choppers were recalled to the target two minutes earlier than planned.
Then at last, someone found the underground bunker. It was in an entirely different place to where they had thought it to be and was under all the rubble from the perimeter wall. It contained the safe and some terrorists, but their find had come too late. They didn’t have the time to deal with it.
As the choppers touched down the troops ran out with the bulging sacks of captured paperwork. While _The Black Swine_ stood guard, they threw their sacks on ground sheets, tied up the corners and loaded them into the choppers.
The CO, his passengers, the capture who was still claiming he was next doors gardener, were already in the command chopper ready to take their leave.
“LIFT OFF! LIFT OFF!” Garth Barrett ordered over the radio. But the choppers made no move to leave.
What the hell was the problem? Why were they not taking off, they all wanted to know in the command chopper?
But the soldiers, while very aware about the desperate urgency to be gone, were determined to make the most of their last few moments at the NSO. They were determined not to leave behind one scrap of paper if they could possibly help it.
Eventually, the last of their haul was slung into the choppers, the soldiers squeezed in after it and up the heavy-laden helicopters staggered, leaving a plume of black smoke hanging over the shell of the NSO. It was exactly 07h30. According to their original timings, they should have already been across the border.
Two Hunters orbitted high above to provide top cover during the pull-out phase.
The initial plan had been to circle right around Lusaka before heading homewards. But it was felt that the safest route out was to fly straight over the centre of the city. The Zambians would not be expecting them to take that route and would not be too keen to fire weapons with civilians around.
They flew over the ring of Zambian troops who had been deployed and they could clearly see armaments in the back of the trucks. The Zambians kept their heads down and no doubt their fingers crossed and did not make a move to do anything aggressive.
The Rhodesians passed the odd hotel very low and observed the occasional rather startled face peering out at them.
There could be no mistaking the Rhodesian choppers for Zambian aircraft and as they flew across the capital, both blacks and whites stopped and waved at the Rhodesian raiders.
Other Zambians were not so sure about the events that morning and scattered to the four winds.
As they flew home, the SAS dropped thousands of leaflets over the city calling for friendly relations with Zambia and stressing the raid had not been against the Zambian Government or her people but against ZIPRA.
Then the command Dakota crew gave the alert that the Zambian MiGs had definitely been scrambled to search for them. A couple of the pilots shouted to their passengers above the clatter of the engines for them to keep an eye out for them ... and they set course for home, revising their plan and asking that fuel be brought right up to the Zambezi by the fifth 205.
As the choppers flew low, carrying the soldiers southwards, the locals came out of their huts to wave at them, just as they had done to the SAS ground troops after the raid on Nkomo’s house.
The route was constantly varied to take advantage of the terrain and hopefully to avoid the MiGs, and a grid reference was passed where they wanted the spare 205 to meet them with the extra fuel.
They got clear of Zambia without incident. By now fuel was extremely low and the Bells landed immediately after crossing the Zambezi, refuelling from the spare 205.
Martin, and the wounded corporal were loaded into the fifth chopper and it headed for Salisbury.
The Hunters, which had struck at FC camp that morning, were by now readying themselves to take part in a ceremonial fly-past at the opening of the country’s first black-dominated parliament.
SB officer John Grey lost no time checking out his blindfolded capture. While the choppers were refuelling, he took _The Black Swine_ on one side and asked him who their prisoner was. He was Alexander Brisk Vusa, the Russian-trained deputy head of intelligence. A prize indeed.
In the face of such a positive identification, Vusa had no hope of continuing with his gardener story.
“When I heard the choppers, I thought it was the Zambians,” he told the SB officer.
“Then I heard the firing. I can’t believe you came all the way to Lusaka,’” he said incredulously and full of wide-eyed admiration. “I just can’t believe it...” Since the raid on Nkomo’s home, the ZIPRA hierarchy had not dared risk sleeping in the NSO any more, he said, and that was why they had not found Dabengwa and the others there. They were too scared to set up a routine pattern of movement, and used to spend as little time as possible in their offices.
They generally came to work every day at 08h00 and were all gone by nine. No one wanted to be caught out again by the Rhodesians.
They had been extremely lucky to find him at the NSO, Vusa said. He normally stayed with his girlfriend, but he had got drunk the previous night and slept if off at the NSO.
The guard had also been strengthened as a result of the Rhodesian raids on _The Fat Man’s_ house, and many of the new guards who had escaped that attack had transferred from Nkomo’s house.
ZIPRA were obviously extremely concerned at the possibility of a raid on the NSO.
However it was not until after the war that it was discovered that they had actually been expecting one.
Dumiso Dabengwa later claimed he had a dream about a Rhodesian raid and that was why he was not there. But other ZIPRA hierarchy told security force chiefs it was because they were _forewarned_. That was why the guard had been trebled and why there were machinegun positions.
Exactly who had tipped them off remains a mystery as there was more than one spy in the know.
If the guards had been told anything at all, they would probably have expected the Rhodesians to come by road and in the dead of night, like the last time.
In any event, despite not being able to capture the three top NSO men, despite all the problems of arriving late at the target, being low on fuel, finding more buildings than they had expected, machineguns and more guards, the op had been a total success. After the war, “C” Squadron operators rated it one of the best-rehearsed and organised operations they had taken part in.
Despite the tip-off, they had brought back a member of the ZIPRA hierarchy who would prove to be a very significant capture.
And they had returned with many tons of records representing virtually every piece of paper inside the NSO.
ZIPRA claimed that all their top secret papers had been locked in the underground bunker, but the Rhodesians found a catalogue of all the records held in the complex and there was very little missing.
The choppers had been so full of documents that one of the sausage bags fell out and landed slap bang in the middle of the courtyard of a suburban police station. A police van duly roared into Kabrit and a fairly-switched on policeman leapt out, grinned and stated: “I guess this little lot belongs to you guys!”
The sacks were piled high in the SAS briefing room and it was only when they started sifting through the pile did they realise they had an incredible assortment of blockbuster material detailing political and military strategy. The documents blew the lid off ZIPRA’s secret operations.
So dynamic were they that in one of its rare revelations of details. ComOps displayed part of the massive haul to the press and openly admitted that the skilfully executed mission had probably been the most important undertaken by the security forces.
Snatches read from the documents at the press briefing revealed the bitter differences between ZAPU and its Patriotic Front partner, ZANLA, which one document claimed could “easily be wiped out.”
What was _not_ revealed to the press was that the NSO had a spy ring and the Rhodesians now had all the names of the agents feeding ZIPRA intelligence.
The contents of one letter sent to Nkomo by a white Rhodesian were considered high treason material and hushed up. Fortunately for him, the man - once a prominent personality in Rhodesia’s public life- had fled the country thereby escaping prosecution.
He had told Nkomo - whose terrorists had shot down the two Viscounts - that Rhodesia was using a certain anti-heat seeking paint on their civilian aircraft to offset attacks from SAM-7 missiles.
A white security force deserter had also given accurate and important intelligence to Nkomo in a tape-recorded briefing.
ZAPU, the political wing, had set up a spy ring of radical European sympathisers in the UK and elsewhere with the sole object of obtaining intelligence that would prove useful to ZIPRA. Many of the spies had previously been in the Rhodesian security forces and one of their aims was to undermine the morale of the European population in Rhodesia.
“Friendly agencies”- the International Defence and Aid Fund. the British Communist Party. Amnesty International. the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the South Africa National Congress, the South African War Assistance Committee were channelling their intelligence to ZAPU. And because of Nkomo’s close ties with the KGB, it was all being fed to Moscow.
A white journalist in Rhodesia codenamed Jason was feeding Nkomo intelligence as was a British journalist, a member of the British Communist Party, who operated under the codename Alison.
They were buying up all the Rhodesian war books and literature they could lay their hands on inside Rhodesia and overseas, publications setting out the strengths of the army, air force and police reserves.
This was being analysed by Nkomo’s Department of Analysis and Research and the findings fed to the military high command. ZIPRA thus had an up-to-date intelligence picture on Rhodesian security force capabilities.
The spy, Jason, had forwarded notes made at a closed “invitation only’” meeting of voters at Chisipite High School, Salisbury, and addressed by the Co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. Mr P.K. van der Byl. They had also infiltrated the Scorpion organisation - for ex-Rhodesians - in England and were visiting public houses frequented by ex-Rhodesians to gain intelligence.
The documents were also to reveal that Nkomo had an agent working in Combined Operations and the incriminating piece of evidence even gave his name. Later still it was learned he was a KGB agent.
He worked in an office which gave him access to just about all the goings-on at ComOps, the most important building in the land.
The man was subsequently watched and his movements monitored, but no action was taken against him. For by the time the piece of paper giving his name had been found among the tons of captured documents, the war had all but run its course.
Papers also spoke of a “high ranking officer” in the army being on the terrorist’s side, but he was not named and come the end of the war the intelligence agencies still did not know exactly who he was. Later information however, indicated that the agent was an intelligence officer, who, in his dealings with ZIPRA, passed himself off as being in the army.
Once again the raid made headlines around the world. It had come a little more than five weeks before the Commonwealth conference in Lusaka to be attended by Queen Elizabeth, who would address the summit at the Mulungushi Hall, two kilometres from the scene of the raid.
It demonstrated how powerless Zambia’s own forces were in the face of an attack from any side and as the Rhodesians had clearly shown they were capable of striking fight up to the conference hall’s front door.
(A _Sunday Mail_ cartoon would show Rhodesian Air Force hero, _Green Leader_, grinning from his Hawker Hunter and giving the Queen the thumbs up to land at Lusaka). The Royal Air Force was to work out lengthy flight plans to avoid Rhodesian air space.
But the operation had cost squadron commander Martin Pearse his life and the SAS’s victory was tinged with sadness.
His death was a tremendous shock to everyone and a very bad blow for “C” Squadron. He had been such a figurehead for the younger men and seemed to inspire most of the great team spirit they had. He was held in the highest esteem too by the air force and ranked equally in ability and bravery with the SAS hierarchy.
Martin, who had come first in the Order of Merit on his officer’s course, saw Operation _Carpet_ as one of the culminating points of his career. Yet his overwhelming premonition of his own death did not undermine his determination.
Three days after the successful raid Martin had masterminded, and the day he had been due to get his Silver Cross of Rhodesia, he was cremated. Within a few hours of the cremation, Martin’s widow accepted the award from Army Commander Lieutenant-General Sandy Maclean, at a moving ceremony attended by the entire regiment and their families.
Martin’s Silver Cross was awarded “for gallantry and leadership in action above the call of duty” as were those of the two other squadron commanders, Captain Colin Willis and Captain Bob McKenna.
The event was the first for many months in which all three squadrons were out of the bush and back in Salisbury at the same time. It was also the only medals parade attended by the entire regiment.

Meanwhile, the Op _Carpet_ capture was being extremely co-operative.
“You know,” Alexander Brisk Vusa was telling SB officer John Grey, “there’s something funny going on near JZ camp.”
“Oh really?” John appeared not to take much notice but the intelligence officer in him knew he was on to something significant.
“They never used to let me in there; it was all very strange,” the capture was saying.
It certainly was, John Grey thought. Vusa, as deputy head of intelligence, had made many trips to JZ terror camp to visit the NSO policemen who were undergoing their training there. He was clearly an important man, one of the hierarchy, yet not even he was allowed access to this mysterious area south of the camp.
Vusa had also seen heavily-laden trucks visiting the place; had seen the head of logistics driving towards there.
It was not only Vusa who was fascinated by JZ camp now. Could this be the place the Rhodesians had been searching for for so long? If so, they had just got themselves a lucky break.
They knew that Libyan aircraft had been making secret night-time flights from Angola and landing in Lusaka, offloading their large supplies of weapons from Russia and East Germany under cover of darkness. Such vast resupplies of weapons were clearly destined for Nkomo’s conventional forces in training at Mulungushi. But where was _The Fat Man_ hiding his weaponry?
(The West’s apparent lack of recognition of the Muzorewa government had encouraged the Russians and East Germans to move in arms and men to train ZIPRA.)
The Zambians were doing their level best to control weapons at this stage. ZIPRA were all too fond of selling their weapons to Zambian civilians and as a result, there had been an increase in armed robberies.
The Zambians were insisting that ZIPRA weaponry be kept in the national stores where it would be issued only on requisition.
But the Rhodesians knew that ZIPRA were loath to stick to this plan. They wanted control of their own weaponry - hence the secret night-time flights from Angola.
Could they be hoarding them at the same place Vusa had just tipped them off about? It was the merest hint that something was in the air and it was too good a chance to miss.
A Canberra overflew the area south of JZ camp, fifteen kilometres (nine miles) west of Lusaka, on a reconnaissance mission and the photographic interpretation indicated there were a vast amount of weapons cached all over the bush. There were heavy vehicle tracks under practically every tree on the fifteen-acre area, and there were also bunkers and trenches.
An immediate decision was made to send the SAS in to _take out_ the place as soon as possible.
The main JZ camp, a training/holding area which also included a political commissar’s camp, would also be hit.
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
In Lusaka, the NSO people were counting their dead and wounded.
Realising that Vusa was missing, they asked themselves what he knew that could be damaging to them, and came up with the probability that he either suspected or knew of the site of the arms dump.
Nkomo was hurriedly put in the picture with the NSO hierarchy recommending that the arms be moved as soon as possible.
But there was _such_ a vast quantity that to move them would have been a monumental exercise. It was the biggest arms dump in Zambia, totalling something like 100 tons. They simply could not move it quickly at such short notice. Nkomo decided against the recommendation.
It was a decision that was to cost him dearly. For even as he debated the problem, the SAS squadron commanders were being summoned to the briefing room at Kabrit where they were put in the picture about the new op.
Operation _Chicory_ was to be a quickie raid, CO Garth Barrett told them. They were to fly straight to the target and would only be on the ground for three and a half hours. Speed and efficiency would be the essence of the exercise.
Fifty men drawn from all three squadrons were to mount an attack to destroy as much war material as possible... kill terrorists... and recover any worthwhile documents and prisoners.
The commander’s brief was to keep conflict with the Zambian army to a minimum. Shooting Zambian soldiers would only detract from the political advantage gained by exposing ZIPRA’s massive arms dump to the Zambian authorities.
As usual, none of the troops was told what the target was or when the op would be mounted. They were only told to prepare for a camp-type attack and get their operational kit ready. It was to be an open Rhodesian raid again without _Black-Is-Beautiful_.
They were stood down, and that week-end the commanders worked out the detailed planning of their particular phases.
The intelligence services meanwhile were having a chat to the commander of ComOps, General Peter Walls: “Hell, sir. Everything’s happened so fast. We haven’t even told CIO or the police about this op.”
“Okay. It doesn’t matter,” the general assured them. “We’ll just go ahead and do it.”
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
At 05h00 on Sunday, July 1, the SAS were back in camp and ready for action. The operators drew their equipment and were very soon on their way to the refuelling point at Bumi Hills on the banks of Lake Kariba. The red bali on the horizon that was the sun was already coming up over the silent lake.
It was only now that the troops and the chopper pilots were briefed what the target was to be. For the “C” Squadron operators, it would be their second raid into the Lusaka area in less than a week.
They drew extra ammunition and bulk explosives from RSM Pete Allan, but it was not necessary to take much as they knew they would be able to make use of the armaments at the target. They studied the aerial photographs, rehearsed their sweepline formations along the airstrip until everyone knew exactly where he was going and what he was doing once at the target.
As it was a Sunday, they did not expect to find many ZIPRA in camp.
Canberras and Hunters would be going in ahead of the troops to bomb the camp ... to neutralise the camp and making it safe for the Bells to land.
Overall control of the ground and air operations was to be from the command Dakota with General Walls directing operations, and two Hunters would provide top cover to protect the ground troops from enemy air retaliation.
Five Bells - every serviceable one Rhodesia possessed - would take the SAS to the target. There would not be single Bell in reserve in the event of something going wrong. No other army in the world would have undertaken such an operation without a reserve machine standing by. It was against all the rules of war. Rhodesia, of course, did not have the benefit of such luxuries.
Back in the heart of Salisbury, the capture, Alexander Brisk Vusa, the man who had put them on to their hot target, had his feet up at the five-star Monomatapa Hotel with SB funds footing the bill.
He had been so co-operative that Special Branch decided to keep him there until Operation _Chicory_ was over, then he would be driven to his home outside Salisbury to resume a normal life again.
He was confined to his room, not that that worried him too much. After the deprivations of a terrorist’s life where the rations were bad and there was the constant threat of a security force attack, he was not about to complain about plush surroundings, a soft bed and whatever he wanted from the hotel kitchen. Later, he would give the SB extensive lectures on Soviet training and spy methods.
At the other end of the country the fifty SAS operators were climbing aboard the five Bells for their Sunday afternoon visit to Zambia. At 12h45 the pilots started up their engines, lifted off over the lake and set course for Zambia.
Almost an hour later, the Canberras and Hunters suddenly overtook the five Bells, sweeping low to make their strikes. The war planes struck, shattering the peace of that sleepy Sunday afternoon.
Large clouds of black smoke and dust billowed up in front of the approaching heliborne troops. They peered out of the choppers to get a better look. In another four minutes it would be their turn to attack.
The moment the choppers touched down in three separate dropping areas, the troops, their dries at the ready, jumped out, deploying immediately into their sweepline formations.
Then they advanced towards their designated targets - the munitions caches, and the political commissar’s camp. Just as their briefing had indicated, there was only a small caretaker force on duty and resistance was light.
Soon 100-high metre sheets of flames and debris were raining down all over the camp and 122 millimetre rockets were burning and zig-zagging in every direction as the SAS set about destroying the camp.
At the nearby political commissars camp 500 tents full of personal belongings and weapons went up in smoke and there were so many tents, that at one stage, the SAS ran out of matches.
Meanwhile, Zambian Air Force MiG pilots were climbing into their planes at Lusaka and Mumbwa air bases. They knew the Rhodesians were still on the ground.
They knew too that the choppers still had to return to collect them and carry them back home. But the Zambians were also aware that the Hunters would be in a top cover role, high above the SAS.
Suddenly, a Rhodesian Hunter pilot saw two silver-coloured MiGs below him in a low-level battle formation.
“Permission to shoot them down with a Sidewinder?” he radioed to callsign Dolphin 1 - General Walls - orbitting in the command Dak.
“If they show any sign of coming for you, then by all means. But if they don’t, leave them,” came the general’s reply.
However, the MiG pilots harboured no aggressive intentions. Their radar controller was furiously trying to direct them on to target but the pilots were completely ignoring his instructions. All they did was fly from their bases to JZ camp - then fly back home again.
Then a column of Zambian armoured vehicles approached but wisely decided to keep well away from the Rhodesians.
All too soon, it approached last light and the troops moved to the landing zone to await the arrival of the choppers to take them home. Enemy RPG-7 rockets and Strelas were still exploding as the troops’ own prepared charges continued to go off.
As one chopper came in, it was rocked in the air by the deafening blast from a cache of Russian demolitions kit going up.
The loaded choppers lifted off, and as they did, the Zambian troops decided it was now safe enough to take on the Rhodesians with smallarms fire. But none hit home and the choppers continued on their way.
Then one hit a tree with its rotor blade. The occupants held their breath, but all was well and the chopper remained airborne.
As they headed homewards, fires were still smouldering from the 100 tons of weapons, ammunition, tents, canoes, cars, blankets and medical equipment that had gone up in smoke. What had once been the biggest ammunition dump in Zambia was now a bombed and blackened reminder of the lightning Rhodesian raid.
The long list of arms and ammunition destroyed was based on actual counts done and included 2 000 kilograms of plastic explosive, 400 anti-tank landmines and 85 assorted mines, 500 x 60 millimetre mortar bombs, 800 hand grenades, 400 x 82 millimetre bombs, 104 PPSH sub-machineguns, 1 050 SKS dries, 600 RPG-7 rockets, 216 limpet mines, 80 AK rifles, 400 rifle grenades and 30 anti-personnel mines, 21 light machineguns, nine sub-machineguns, eight Thompson machineguns, 160 B-10 rockets, 70 x 122 millimetre rockets, 213 metres of _Cordtex_ detonating cord, one 3,5 millimetre rocket launcher, seven RPDs, 726 000 rounds of smallarms ammunition, 50 compasses, 13 RPG-7 sights, two 75 millimetre recoilless rifles - plus two cars, one Land-Rover, four outboard motors, 75 Klepper canoes, several inflatable boats and 14 tons of diesel fuel.
Both operations had been enormously successful for the Rhodesians producing fantastic results, and it was unfortunate that Martin Pearse had not been there to reap the benefits of his superb efforts.
The enemy certainly had not been up and waiting for them this time. Perhaps the fact they had not told CIO or the police had something to do with it? Perhaps that was where their weakness lay? Maybe someone there was responsible for all the spy leaks?
The attack had temporarily put paid to Nkomo’s plans to mount an invasion. For that 100 tons of hidden weaponry had been earmarked for not only his nonconventional forces but his conventional troops too.
The arms dump represented his total reserves. It was at that stage, his last hope for arming his battalions for conventional assaults on Rhodesia.
The arms had been the ace up his sleeve, the weapons he had been relying on for his battalions in training at Mulungushi; and now he had lost them. It would mean he would have to hold back his battalions until he got a resupply - if he got one - and he could only hope the weaponry arrived in time to deploy his forces into Rhodesia prior to a ceasefire.
Meanwhile, Nkomo was hell-bent on training as many police, customs officers, pilots, all the people for his government-in-exile, as possible. More and more men were reporting to Mulungushi and Boma for conventional training in readiness to take over Rhodesia.
The potential threat still existed... could the security forces do anything about the build-up in time... could they prevent the invasion?
