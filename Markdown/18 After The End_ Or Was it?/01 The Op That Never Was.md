An uneasy peace now hung over the country. The British were in control and the final chapter of the Rhodesian saga was all but over.  
For the first time since the bush war had begun, most of the enemy and all the hierarchy were inside the country. And this time, they were all in legally.  
Since the start of the somewhat shaky ceasefire, they had poured across from Mozambique and Zambia and although almost 22 000 terrorists had entered the various assembly points around the country in accordance with the Lancaster House Agreement, they were not all guerillas.  
Such gentlemanly agreements made around conference tables might work in London, but it was all very different in the bush… and thousands of _mujibas_ had reported to the assembly points as a showpiece, leaving a high proportion of real terrorists free to roam the countryside, have a presence in every kraal, and intimidate voters.  
Their respective political wings were recognised, and party officials bought and rented offices and houses in the capital and suburbs. Electioneering began immediately and was both bloody and intense.  
The international press, too, representing everybody from Pravda to The London Times, poured into the country to record the rallies, the intrigues, the occasional bombings that rocked the capital - and the passing of an era. (Many of the Soviet and eastern European journalists were intelligence agents and the British had arranged for their visas to expire the day after the election results were announced.) The official observers, there to determine if the elections were free and fair, began a round of facility trips to the assembly areas and places of interest.  
In the sixteen assembly points and thirty-nine interim rendezvous points, 450 members of the ceasefire monitoring force kept an eye on the ZANLA and ZIPRA men, while around the capital, Australian, British, Nigerian, and Fijian forces could be seen hurrying about their business in distinctive British Army Land-Rovers, with large white crosses on the sides, and specially flown to Salisbury for the exercise.  
Behind the scenes, too, there was much to keep the security forces occupied.  
Shortly after the signing of the December 21 ceasefire agreement, the various Rhodesian security force unit commanders and other officers were summoned together and told quite categorically that there was no chance of Robert Mugabe winning the election.  
At a specially convened conference at the air force cricket pavilion in Salisbury, a member of the military hierarchy told the large assembled audience that Mugabe could not, and would not, win.  
In answer to several questions, he made it perfectly clear that the use of military force would prevent any unexpected election victory for Mugabe.  
The unit commanders were then tasked to assure their troops that Mugabe would never come to power.., and this they did to buoy up morale and keep confidence at an acceptable level during that extremely sensitive period in the country’s history.  
A special committee comprising high-ranking army, air force personnel and intelligence officers was then set up to plan the organisation and details of a coup de main (an attack achieving complete surprise), and they met in different houses and fiats around the city.  
The mission was divided into two phases – Operation _Hectic_ and Operation _Quartz_.  
Operation _Hectic_ was the covert action against selected personnel; _Quartz_ the elimination of major targets in Salisbury as well as others dotted around the countryside.  
For the military plan to succeed, Robert Mugabe, the most hated and feared man in white Rhodesia, had to be assassinated.  
Special forces had always hoped to eliminate him in Mozambique, but Mugabe had proved a slippery target. (There was even talk of assassinating him in London while at the Lancaster House talks, but the scheme was quickly abandoned.) Now that he was inside the country they might have better luck. But although several schemes were hatched, it almost seemed as if the plot was jinxed from the outset.  
One plan involved eliminating him with a radio-activated explosive device as he returned from an election rally at Fort Victoria. But someone miscalculated, the explosion missed his vehicle- and Mugabe escaped with his life.  
On another occasion, special forces planned to rid themselves of him while he was on a visit to Bulawayo. A Selous Scout, hidden in an ambulance, was to kill him as he arrived at Bulawayo airport. If, for some reason, that plan didn’t work, the SAS were to ambush him as he drove to address supporters in a city stadium.  
As insurance, there was a third plan. A Selous Scout, posing as one of the vast press corps, was to eliminate him with a radio-activated device built into a microphone and already in position on the dias.  
But the plan was not to succeed. Robert Mugabe set out for Bulawayo... got right to the steps of the plane - then he turned on his heels and cancelled his trip. Even his bodyguard had been till then unaware of his change of heart.  
It was almost as if a well-placed source in high places had put him one step ahead of them.  
Indeed, when a man now suspected of being in the pay of a foreign country, heard what was being planned in Bulawayo, he went “bananas” as he had no prior knowledge of it, claims one source.  
When Operation _Hectic_ (against certain individuals) began to go sour, two senior members of the security forces, one the SAS CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett, sought an interview with the man. “We suspected the man of stuffing up _Hectic_. He was putting impossible conditions on the mission. We knew the various places Mugabe was sleeping- but he said he was not to be killed in Salisbury- then it was Bulawayo. There was another plan to kill him on the road to Gwelo, but he didn’t allow that either,” said Barrett.

SAS operators, meanwhile, were keeping track of former terrorists who had moved into the city, watching their many houses and offices and monitoring their movements and routines.  
“A” Squadron spent many long weeks in a detailed surveillance and reconnaissance, and a special slush fund had to be set up to finance the operation.  
As it Was essential that the surveillance teams did not use the same vehicles all the time, Stu Hulley-Miller, the SAS/SB liaison officer, visited South Africa and spent thirty-six thousand rand on 12 Datsuns, vehicles which would not warrant a second glance in Rhodesia. He spent a further ninety-six thousand rand on sophisticated radio communications.  
The surveillance teams exchanged their usual camouflage uniforms for civilian clothing and operated from a number of rented flats and houses around the capital.  
Meanwhile, other plans were afoot to blunt a possible Mugabe win.  
The initial conference at the cricket pavilion was followed by a second orders group held in the operations rooms of Combined Operations and attended by all commanding officers. The commanders of the country’s main units - Garth Barrett of the SAS, Chadie Aust of the RLI, and Pat Armstrong of the Selous Scouts - sat next to each other to hear a ComOps brigadier deliver his orders.  
Outline directives were issued on a military plan (_Quartz_) which was to come into effect on the initiation of a particular codeword, and then the entire orders group dealt with the plan.  
With thousands of former terrorists conveniently massed in their assembly points, security force units were to attack and eliminate terrorists in several assembly areas; while a number of other assembly points were to be bombed, with security force personnel directing the jets on to target from their observation positions.  
Essential to the success of the operation was the SAS’s part in the plot.  
Their mission involved the assassination of Robert Mugabe, his vice-president, Simon Muzenda, senior commander Rex Nhongo, and hundreds of ZANLA in separate buildings around the capital.  
(By now, the charismatic ZANLA military leader Josiah Tongogara had been killed in a “car accident” in Mozambique. Rhodesian intelligence sources are convinced that despite all evidence to the contrary, the accident was rigged and Tongogara was assassinated. He was felt to be too pragmatic and there were some who wanted him out of the way. “Friends” helped them achieve this objective.) SAS “A” Squadron operators were to eliminate the ZANLA leader at his home in Quorn Avenue, Mount Pleasant... as well as supporters in two houses in the Belvedere South area of Salisbury.  
“B” Squadron was to kill vice-president Simon Muzenda at his home in Enterprise Road. Highlands... as well as 100 ZANLA men at the nearby Medical Arts Centre, the ZANU administrative headquarters.  
“C” Squadron had been tasked with the biggest target- the University of Rhodesia’s audio-visual centre where 200 ZANLA and ZIPRA men were housed in a military headquarters together with their senior officers, Rex Nhongo (ZANLA), Dumiso Dabengwa (ZIPRA) and Lookout Musika (ZIPRA).  
While the “A” and “B” Squadron operators were to kill everyone at their assorted ZANLA houses around the capital there was to be a slightly different plan at the “C” Squadron target, the only building which housed both ZANLA and ZIPRA.  
The word was going to be quietly passed to the ZIPRA men in the centre about the forthcoming attack Then, as soon as they were given the opportunity of surrendering they were to make their way outside to a holding area.  
Those who did not take up the offer – and it was expected every ZANLA would remain to fight it out – would be killed.  
“C” Squadron commander Bob McKenna and his men knew that ZANLA would be heavily armed, but it didn’t worry them unduly. No one would have survived the SAS raid.  
For when they opened up on the university building, they were to do so with eight Russian T55 tanks - each with a 100 millimetre main armament, 12,7 millimetre heavy machinegun and a 7,62 millimetre co-axial machinegun. Then, there was a 20 millimetre cannon, RPG-7 rocket launchers and automatic rifles.  
It was to be the most fire support the SAS had ever had available to them in their entire history, and the results were guaranteed to inflict total overkill In the highly unlikely event of a few enemy escaping with their lives, they would be reduced to jibbering idiots just from the shock, noise, smoke, flame and the psychological value of having tanks used against them.  
After the tanks had done their worst, the SAS would storm the building, killing everyone left in sight  
The tanks – originally destined for Uganda before surreptitiously finding their way to Rhodesia – were kept at Inkomo Barracks, 25 kilometres (14 miles) from Salisbury, where “C” Squadron underwent extensive familiarisation courses. The SAS developed a good rapport with the _tankees_ who were to operate the T55s during the attack on the building,  
At the “A” and “B” Squadron targets, the SAS would have Eland 90 armoured cars manned by crews from the Armoured Car Regiment- each sporting its main 90 millimetre gun.  
They would also have top secret sanctions-busting 106 millimetre recoilless antitank dries which were to be used for the first time.., as well as 20 millimetre cannons, 12,7 millimetre heavy machineguns, RPD light machineguns and rifles.  
The heavy weapons would have soon punched the buildings to pieces and after a few shots from the 106 millimetre recoilless dries, the “A” and “B” Squadron targets in Mount Pleasant, Belvedere and Enterprise Road, would be reduced to rubble.  
If there was anything left standing, they would sweep through the ruins and kill any survivors.  
Rehearsals for the operation were intensive and thorough, and as the targets were in the capital, the reconnaissance of the buildings was the best available. They were able to walk past them every day, either under the guise of being civilians or dressed as _Wombles_ (Police Reservists), checking out the access routes, guard systems, the position of neighbouring houses, and to look for suitable arcs of fire.  
They were also able to drive past in convoys on their way to and from manning strategic points around the capital in the run-up to the election.  
The heavily armed and helmetted troops soon became familiar sights around the city. They were there in their Eland 90 armoured cars, Sabres and troop-carrying vehicles as civilians went to work each morning; and there when they returned home.  
Officially, their presence was to boost white confidence, yet it also provided the SAS with the perfect cover, enabling them to drive past their targets without arousing suspicion, update their intelligence and work out their timings for the attack.  
From their positions on street intersections and junctions, the SAS would be able to get to their respective targets within minutes of the codeword being received.  
In the case of “C” Squadron, they would be able to throw a cordon around the university building within two minutes, using their Sabres and troop-carrying vehicles.  
Two minutes later, the tanks would arrive to close off the cordon and, using a loud hailer, Bob McKenna would give the residents at the university centre the opportunity of surrendering,  
Those who decided to run away would be quickly cut down… and those who preferred a fight would be blasted to kingdom come with the full wrath of eight tanks, a 20 millimetre cannon, rockets and assorted weaponry.  
The initial barrage would last a full two minutes after which the front tank would breach the two-metre-high security wall around the hostel. The front mudguards had been removed to prevent bricks getting caught up and slowing down their advance.  
The tank would then reverse, leaving the way clear for Lieutenants Rich Stannard, Phil Brooke and Mike Rich and their house-clearing teams to spill through the breach and storm the building.  
Wearing full body armour, the teams would hasten to their appointed floors in the centre and systematically set about clearing the corridors and rooms.  
Initially, they would use the Rhodesian version of the British stun grenade to frighten and disorientate ZANLA. The grenades were similar to those used by 22 SAS for their highly successful attack on the Iranian Embassy in London, and the Rhodesian copies had been specially made for the mission by one of the army’s demolition experts, himself an ex-SAS member.  
Then, once their grenades had done their job, the storm troopers would follow up with AK fire.  
As the three groups cleared each of their allocated rooms with precision timing.  
they would hang sheets out of the windows to indicate their progress to overall commander Bob McKenna waiting below.  
The three commanders inside the building would be in radio contact with the commander and he would organise extra ammunition and dispatch replacements for those who might be wounded.  
The tanks, meanwhile, would have pulled back into a forming-up area_ By this stage, “A” and “B” Squadrons would be storming whatever was left standing of their targets and neutralising all opposition, including the Number One target, Robert Mugabe, and the Number Two, Simon Muzenda.  
The “C” squadron target would have taken the longest to neutralise, but the entire operation would have been all over bar the shouting by the time most civilians got out of bed.  
The intelligence on their targets was extremely detailed and in the case of the three-storey university building and the Medical Arts Centre in Enterprise Road, they had been provided with the complete floor plans. They knew who slept in each bed, what weapons each man had and knew where all the RPG-7 rocket launchers and machineguns were kept  
Exhaustive battle preparations and house-clearing drills for all the targets were carried out at Kabrit Barracks.  
Every imaginable contingency was practised, from starting and extinguishing fires, sorting out casualties, to the communications they would use in the buildings during the raid.  
Finally, all the rehearsals were over and everyone was 100 percent certain of his role in the forthcoming attack. The eight tanks were put on low-loaders, cQvered and moved under the cloak of darkness to KG VI Barracks, in readiness for the attack.  
The Armoured Car Regiment with their armoured cars moved out to live at the SAS barracks during this time.  
The mission was one of the most-detailed and well-planned operations of the war.  
The plan and the timings were perfect. The rehearsals could not have been better and the fire support was the best available.  
Other members of the security forces were in observation positions overlooking the assembly points ready to call in the jets. The planes had been bombed up: the crews  were on standby.  
Everyone was keyed up and raring to go. Now all they needed was the codeword.  
Each evening the SAS storm-troopers were told that the mission would take place the following day.., but as each morning came and went, there was still no word. The RLI, meanwhile, who were initially tasked to attack two assembly areas on the initiation of the codeword, were recalled to Salisbury. It was now five days before the elections and the battalion was deployed around Salisbury instead of taking on the assembly areas.  
The morale and the level of confidence in the RLI was extremely high. While only the RLI CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Charlie Aust and his adjutant knew of the plan to eliminate the ZANLA leaders, most of the RLI felt that, having mobilised such a large force so close to the election, that there was going to be some sort of military action.  
And fight until the last moment, almost everyone else involved in the scheme thought the same.  
![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
Meanwhile, at lunchtime on Sunday, March 2, two days before the election results were to be announced, four SAS men were waiting at Kabrit Barracks for the all-clear to carry out their particular role in a contingency plan only.  
Robert Mugabe and every one of his 28 members ofthe ZANU Central Committee had flown out to Maputo for the weekend - and a Mozambican jet was due to bring them back to Salisbury on Sunday afternoon.  
Salisbury’s civilian airport was fight next door to Kabrit Barracks and the four operators were ideally placed to follow their orders and shoot the plane down with Strela as it began its approach to the runway. They had done a target study and knew that almost noone would have been left alive in the plane. However, while eager to get to grips with ZANU personalities, some of the SAS operators involved were against the scheme as there was a possibility of hitting the pilot and crew. There was a resistance against following the order and much debate.  
But then, as the Mozambican plane crossed the border to the Eastern Highlands, the SAS was told that the contingency plan was off.  
“It was a categoric ‘No’. After consultation with the intelligence people, the military said it was impossible,” the SAS CO explained.  
![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
Two days later, the SAS were still positioned on strategic comers, just minutes away from their targets - and still waiting for the codeword to eliminate Mugabe and his men.  
But as it got closer to 09h00 and the announcement of the results, most of them realised that the codeword - kept a closely-guarded secret- would never come. Having been assured that everything would turn out all right, they then began to think that perhaps Mugabe had lost the election after all: that there was no need for any military plan.  
But things were not all fight and when they switched their army radios into the local radio frequency, it was to hear that Robert Mugabe had not only won the election, but that his victory was both crushing and absolute.  
He had taken 57 of the 100 parliamentary seats and the unthinkable had come to pass. Robert Mugabe, the arch enemy, was to become the new Prime Minister of an independent and internationally recognised Zimbabwe.  
The reaction among the security forces and the country’s whites was one of paralysing shock, then disbelief, then dismay.  
The hardened SAS operators were disgusted that they had beenduped. All that work: all those rehearsals... Then, nothing. More than once, the SAS had Robert Mugabe in their sights during the run-up to the election. But they were unable to make their move until the word came.  
Some stunned soldiers got from their vehicles and wandered around aimlessly, trying to work out what had gone wrong.  
In the RLI ranks, it was much the same story. As they manned key intersections in their vehicles, each soldier sat wondering what the next chap was thinking.  
Many wept, others maintained a stiff upper lip although the shock and dismay were clearly visible on their faces.  
In the Selous Scouts ops room, hysterical laughter greeted the news that Robert Mugabe had won the election. No one could believe it.  
The pilots on standby to deal with the assembly areas were seen to throw their helmets on to the tarmac in sheer frustration.  
Most whites stayed in their homes. Those who heard the news over their office radios didn’t get much work done that day. Their whole futures were at stake and serious thought had to be given to that.  
There was much panic and many women took their children out of school. Others packed and began heading south to the border. Some businesses shut up shop and the staff went home. Estate agents were inundated with telephone calls from people wanting to put their houses on the market.  
Grim little groups huddled in cafes, hardly touching their drinks.., while in many government offices, work began immediately on shredding secret documents, photographs of terrorist atrocities, whatever could be incriminating in the new order of things.  
In town, young blacks rode around on the back of flatbed trucks yelling Mugabe slogans. They danced in Manica Road, outside the ZANU offices, prancing and strutting like roosters, Mugabe’s election symbol. Here and there, crowing could be heard.  
Overhead, the helicopters circled around to remind people that looting would not be tolerated.., and General Walls appealed for calm. A special noon edition of The HeraM announcing the “’Massive Win for Mugabe’” sold out.  
Both the RLI and SAS were ordered to continue manning the street corners - and to smile to instil confidence in the white population.  
They obeyed their orders - and in defiant mood, they flapped their arms and squawked as the busloads of cheering Mugabe supporters drove by. For a moment, the black youths were nonplussed at such a reaction. It helped to relieve the tension, but underneath it all, the troops were bitterly disappointed.  
Occasionally, a car would draw up and a weeping driver would ask the soldiers what they were going to do about Mugabe’s win. But they were unable to explain that their well-laid plans had gone astray: that the codeword had never come.  
The British, too, were said to be taken aback that nothing had happened. They knew that the security forces had a military plan and were fully expecting it to take place. A high-ranking member of the British contingent was to ask a leading Rhodesian politician why the plan had not gone ahead. The politician, also assured that everything would be “all right”, was unable to tell them.  
Perhaps there was some truth in the theory that Nkomo, when told of the military plan, had stated that he could not be seen to be taking the country from white officers, and that he would be hard-pressed to sell the idea to the west?. Iftrue, there would have been little point in continuing the exercise. No need to change the course of history.  
(The plan had been for Nkomo to head a coalition government.)  
Perhaps ifthe earlier plans on Mugabe’s life had worked: if he had not been tipped off... ?  
But, perhaps things had gone too far and it was all too late anyway... ? And what had happened to the top secret plans to rig the elections? Special Branch Task Force were to have switched ballot boxes during a period when the boxes were unguarded. But at the last minute someone put a stop to the plan.  
And had the spy at ComOps tipped off Mugabe and his men about the operation anyway?. And if he had, would their defences have been any match for tanks, recoilless rifles and machineguns? The only way they could have survived was by not being in the buildings that morning And there are reports that they were not.  
But was it necessary to wait until the dawn of a British-supervised Independence? From the time of the troops” initial briefing it was always envisaged that they would make their move long before then. For the longer they waited and the surveillance was maintained on the key personalities, so the risks of compromise increased.  
But perhaps it was never meant to be after all? A member of the ComOps planning team says that although the possibility of a coup was discussed, the idea was quickly abandoned, for the wrath of the world would have been down on Rhodesia’s shoulders. “We discussed it for 15 minutes,” he said.  
Perhaps then, the “coup” was merely to keep the security forces busy and out of mischief?. Who knows... ?  
The head of CIO, Ken Flower, had meanwhile summoned SB officers to ComOps, to tell them that the possibility of Mugabe winning the election had not been foreseen. Asked if it was still possible to “do something”, he said no, they had to accept the situation.  
The special slush fund set up to finance various aspects of the operation still had several thousands of dollars left in the kitty. But no one wanted to know anything about it anymore. In those traumatic days, there was much back-pedalling, Eventually, it helped some of the SB officers to get out of the country. No one wanted to know about them either.  
Later, two members of the ComOps hierarchy visited Kabrit to offer the soldiers honeyed words of comfort and reassurance. But the SAS men were not impressed, and although the hierarchy handled the situation with great aplomb, it was not the best of meetings.  
As for the RLI, they closed ranks and withdrew into themselves until late October when the unit disbanded and the colours were laid in the vaults of Salisbury’s Anglican Cathedral.  
Shortly after the election, the RLI CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Charlie Aust, walked on to the parade square where the whole battalion was formed up, faced the 600 men whom he had personally assured a few weeks earlier that Mugabe would not come to power, and said:  
“Guys, I’m sorry. It’s a cock-up.”  
There seemed nobody to whom the RLI CO could turn to for guidance during those particularly sensitive days following the election.  
Charlie Aust personally took steps to remove all the battalion treasures out of the country and went to see a member of the hierarchy who had been closely associated with the RLI over the years. As the RLI CO walked into the man’s office he was writing a letter, and did not look up or stop writing the entire three minutes that Charlie Aust was there.  
The RLI commander said he sought the officer’s advice in getting the RLI statue out of the country. He was promptly told not to be a fool.  
“I’ve lived through the trauma of moving from Northern Rhodesia when the Federation broke up and I know all about this sort of thing, Don’t try and be clever.” He then told the RLI CO to clear out of his office.  
It was an unhappy period and there was a great deal of distrust in many quarters.  
Fortunately for the RLI, they were able to smuggle their statue, a tribute to their war dead, out to the safety of South Africa.  
The Selous Scouts were virtually disbanded overnight and their very name became a dirty word in the new order. Unlike the RLI, there was no formal disbandment or parade where they could lay up their standard.  
Even after the election, there were some who thought there was still time to stage a coup, but despite frantic efforts on the part of some determined special force officers, nothing came of the plan. It was over before it had begun. And that was that.  
Later, a feasibility study on the possibility of staging a coup in Zimbabwe was conducted elsewhere in Africa, but the recommendation was that it was all too late.  
General Walls is reported to have said that with the control Robert Mugabe’s party had in the country, a military coup against the Mugabe government would not have lasted more than 48 hours. Many farmers and people in the rural areas would have been killed and it would have been a chaotic state of affairs.  
The security forces were, it was true, thin on the ground at that stage and if they could not have held the country, there’s no doubt there would have been much bloodshed. And the war would have continued.  
Intimidation aside, Robert Mugabe did enjoy massive popular support The 250 000 people who greeted him in Salisbury when he returned from exile was proof of that (although they did turn up to see Joshua Nkomo, too). It would be hard to argue that they had all been intimidated.  
Granted advance intelligence of the election results, General Walls had cabled Margaret Thatcher urging her to declare the election null and void because of massive intimidation. His plea made not the slightest difference. (There are claims that the Foreign Office deliberately held up his request in Nairobi so that Mrs Thatcher did not receive it before the results were announced - thus protecting her from having to make a decision.)  
In the light of reports from election supervisors and observers, who found the elections to be as fair and free as possible in the circumstances, she did not feel there were any grounds to declare the election invalid.  
Whitehall sources considered the General’s plea to have been a non-starter anyway. Mrs Thatcher would have had to cut across the opinion of Commonwealth observers and impose British rule on the country, an action which most certainly would have been opposed by the Commonwealth and the nationalist parties.  
Thus it was that one era came to an end, and another began ...  
The British mopped brows, shook off the African dust.., and Robert Mugabe and his election symbol came home to roost.
