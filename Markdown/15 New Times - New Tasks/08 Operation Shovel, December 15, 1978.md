Just before Christmas, SB got themselves the best present of all - the secretary of the ZANLA high command for Tete Province, whose immediate superior was top operational commander Josiah Tongogara.  
Not only did he know Tete like the back of his hand, he was also familiar with terror camps elsewhere in Mozambique and Tanzania and was able to give SB a wealth of intelligence.  
Then he told them about a massive arms dump being hoarded in a hangar at Tete airfield. A Hunter was immediately dispatched to the airfield and with a single rocket blasted the ammunition dump... and the hangar... and the surrounding buildings off the face of the earth. So intense was the force of the explosion that the pilot almost knocked himself out of the sky, but as he turned for home, he took comfort in the sight of the utter devastation below him.  
It was obvious that ZANLA would lose no time re-establishing and resupplying their ammunition stockpile. Soon a trainload of ammunition would rumble northwards from Beira to Moatize, the station nearest to Tete, and ZANLA would be back in business once more.  
If the security forces could follow the devastating air strike by destroying the rail line... a bridge ... and, as a bonus, hitting a train as well, so much the better.  
Not only would it prevent the ammunition dump being replenished, but with the line blown, nothing and no one - particularly ZANLA - would be able to use the track for some time. ZANLA were using the line to travel from Chimoio to Tete and nearby Chingodzi ... and from there, they were deploying straight into Rhodesia.  
The demolition task was offered to Lieutenant Mac McIntosh, who had just come back from a stint in the bush and about to head off for a well-deserved holiday.  
It was a hot target and Mac jumped at the opportunity. It was a chance in a million and he immediately postponed his holiday.  
The name of the op was to be _Shovel_. If all went well, the enemy could soon be shovelling the remains of a bridge and train out of a riverbed.  
The aerial photographic interpretation had already been done and, based on the information gleaned from it. the explosive charges - 1 000 kilograms of TNT - had been made up specifically for the task.  
Thereafter, everyone involved in the sabotage task moved quickly. Equipment was loaded on to trucks and they set off for Mtoko where they established a tactical headquarters. That night they boarded a Dakota and parachuted into Mozambique.  
Their plan was to establish themselves on the ground, find the bridge and carry out their reconnaissance. Once Mac MacIntosh had evaluated the situation, he would call in the Dakota and the 1 000 kilograms of charges would be dropped fight next to the bridge. For there were only twenty men in their party: not enough to carry such a heavy load of explosives over long distances.  
They found the bridge without difficulty and established themselves in a lay-up position near the bridge ... and the next night, Mac called in the Dakota.  
Soon the dull throb of an aircraft engine could be heard. The Dakota was bang on time. Mac began to talk it in to their position. Above, the dispatchers stood by the open door of the plane and waited for the order to send the explosives through the night.  
But the inexperienced dispatchers on duty that night jumped the gun and pushed the mound of explosives out the door a few vital seconds before the final order... and those all-important seconds made all the difference between the charges landing next to the target as planned and dropping eight kilometres away.  
The ground troops watched in dismay as the parachutes flopped open in the distance. They knew they were in for a hard night’s slog and a few choice words over the radio reached the ears of the very embarrassed dispatchers.  
There was a mumbled apology from above, then the Dak turned and headed homewards carrying the men responsible for their troubles that night to the comfort of a warm bed.  
Back at the Mecito bridge in Mozambique, there was no time for recriminations and no time to be lost. They had to locate every box of explosives and bring them all back to a safe position by the side of the rail line before first light. For there were villages and sidings down both sides of the line and they couldn’t afford to be seen by the locals.  
For hours they laboured - locating the explosives ... sweeping ... struggling through the bush until eventually all the charges and the parachutes were recovered.  
The hot, tired team hid the explosives in a ravine and camouflaged them from prying eyes. As if to round off their troubles that night they had just finished doing that when there was the most torrential downpour. The weary, now wet, men settled down for what was left of the night.  
Next day, the recce party ventured out for a closer inspection of the bridge and found fresh problems.  
To their dismay, it transpired that the photographic interpretation had been totally incorrect. From the air, the bridge must have looked closer to the ground, in reality, it turned out to be twice the size the photographic interpreters had thought.  
As the explosives had been made up from the photographic interpretation, it meant that they were far from custom-made for the bridge. It also meant that the all important accessories for getting the saboteurs under the bridge and the charges in position - the metal ladder and lengths of rope - were useless.  
The ladder would not even reach halfway up the bridge. Instead of being an aid, it was nothing more than a nuisance, for now they had to waste time burying it as its discovery could lead to detection.  
Now faced with an enormous drop, the demolition team would have to be extremely careful. A careless moment, a slip of the foot, and they would plunge to certain death.  
It was a severe set-back but the mission would still go ahead. They would just have to improvise with what they had.  
Back in the safety of their lay-up position, the SAS schemed how to place their charges to the best advantage, and with some initiative and some fairly bright lads particularly Nick Wilson, who had just come off a demolition course - they managed to sort out a system that would get Mac McIntosh and a corporal under the bridge and the explosives safely in position.  
That night, Mac and the corporal returned to test the plan.  
Following their normal procedure, they placed two early-warning groups out, one on either side of the bridge. New SAS officer Lieutenant Mike Rich had the task of sitting on the railway line with the radio, co-ordinating the early-warnings and giving Mac and crew the shout if anyone or anything came along.  
They fastened their length of rope - which had been extended by paracord - on to one of the rail lines and tied a rock on the other end of the rope. They then slung it underneath the bridge... up the other side... took the rock off and tied the rope on to the opposite rail track.  
Mac and the corporal climbed under the bridge and shuffled along it. using the rope to go hand-over-hand along the pier. When they got to a gap, they pulled themselves up on to the ledge. Their legs dangled precariously over the edge of the 13 metre-high bridge and it was such a tight squeeze that they were sitting shoulder-to-shoulder. They were, however, ready for business ...  
Using a chain formation, the incredibly heavy charges were passed down from one man to the next, each steadying them with one hand, then pushing them against the side of the bridge and down to the next man.  
One of the two men under the bridge would lean out, clutch the charges to him with both hands and pull them in under the bridge. Then, as there was no room to manoeuvre, one man would lean out of the way while the other slapped special _Wonder Glue_ on little wooden blocks and stuck them firmly in place under the bridge.  
The blocks had hooks attached to them; and the paracord tied around the charges was threaded through the hooks, then drawn up tight.  
It was a slow, tricky business and they could tell from the beginning that it would take several nights to get all the charges in position.  
As one long hour followed another and the night came down, they made use of their torches.  
Eventually, Mac called a halt. They had not finished yet and would have to spend another night perched under the bridge.  
Mac debated if they should wire up the explosives then and there. If they were compromised, it meant they would be able to blow the bridge before withdrawing. On the other hand, if a local went into the riverbed and looked up, he might catch a glimpse of the wiring system. Mac decided not to take the chance.  
Mac and the corporal took their leave of the bridge, glad of the chance to stretch their legs and rest their aching arms. They met up with the others again then settled down to wait the day out before returning to the bridge again that night.  
During the day, they got a message from Rhodesia warning them to be careful... FRELIMO were very suspicious that their bridges might be demolished.  
Within half an hour, that signal had taken on new meaning. Trundling down their stretch of track came a member of the militia driving a small railway trolley. The trolley passed over the bridge, then slowed right down, cutting its engine just as it got out of sight. Then silence!  
Back in the bushes, the atmosphere was electric. Would the driver come and investigate and discover their explosives? Mac cursed himself for not wiring them up after all.  
Five long minutes ticked by, but the militiaman never came to investigate. The trolley rattled on its way without the Mozambican so much as stretching his legs. It had been nothing more than an incredible coincidence.  
As evening approached and the temperature dropped, the railway lines began the now-familiar nightly clatter as they contracted. Darkness falls quickly in Africa and it was not long before the demolition team had slipped back under the bridge to complete their task.  
By the time they had finished, there were layer upon layer of charges hanging in place. There could be no doubt as to the fate of the bridge or whatever was on it when the bang went off. The charges together with the weight of the train equalled overkill.  
The demolition was ready. All that was needed was to hook up the exploder, turn a handle and press a button. They also needed a train.  
Both steam and diesel trains travelled up and down the line and Mac had to consider which was the most important. Maybe their luck would hold and they would get a troop train. Then while he was trying to make up his mind, the decision was taken out of his hands.  
The enemy ammunition resupply had not yet left for Moatize and it was vital that the bridge be dropped before it got through.  
Back in Salisbury, Lieutenant-Colonel Brian Robinson, now with the ComOps planning team, was more interested in the urgency of the demolition and felt that the sooner a train - any train - was dropped on the bridge, the better it would be. His idea was passed on to the operators and that night - December 15 - Mac and his men took up their positions.  
The commander and his partner moved to their initiation point. By their side was the exploder device. The rest of the men under Lieutenant Mike Rich lay low by the side of the track ready to attack from the rear of the train. Then they settled down and waited.  
At 21h00, a steam train came heaving up the line from the Mozambican coast. Soon Mike and his men saw the twinkle of carriage lights through the darkness. Then as the train passed within ten paces of them, they saw the fireman shovelling coal into the fire.  
As the engine got on to the bridge, Mac McIntosh did his stuff with precision timing. He pressed the button; the bridge erupted and the train blew with it.  
The bulk of the charges hidden under the side of the bridge nearest to the train blew first, followed a micro-second later by the others on the far side. There was a mighty roar, a hiss of steam and all sorts of peculiar noises and crunches. The remains of the engine plunged into the gaping chasm where the bridge had once been - and ended its journey in the riverbed with a deafening crash.  
As it fell, it dragged several open wagons in its wake... and they were left dangling forlornly over the edge. There was so much wreckage it almost filled the gap where once the bridge had been.  
Metal grated upon metal and a big steam cloud hung in the air.  
The lights of the four carriages and small guards van were snuffed out, their power source having come from the wrecked engine.  
By a stroke of luck, the terrified passengers had escaped with their lives. The rail tracks had been blown off the embankment and the passenger carriages had ploughed into the shaking soil instead of continuing on and plunging into the riverbed.  
Mike Rich’s group advanced down the track firing their RPDs and RPG-7s into the back of the train.  
A group of FRELIMO got off the train in a panic. There was a token exchange with the SAS and the Mozambicans made off into the night  
Scores of nervous Africans tumbled off the train along with their goats and chickens and some passengers had the presence of mind to dive straight for the bush.  
The saboteurs swept through the carriages coach-by-coach in search of others.  
They moved down the corridors systematically, forcing open the doors and beckoning the passengers outside. They assured the passengers no harm would befall them, but not everyone believed it. Two were so nervous that the urine stains could be seen seeping through their trousers. Others, relieved that they were to be spared, were over-friendly and readily did as they were bid.  
They were all herded outside and quizzed about FRELIMO activity in the area and willingly supplied the answers. At last, the SAS commander had all the information he wanted and told them to clear off. The passengers, grateful to have escaped death twice that night, took to the hills without a second bidding, muttering among themselves as they fled.  
The SAS used up their left-over explosives to blow the wheels off the coaches and prevent FRELIMO salvaging them.  
After burying a landmine under the big granite chips in the rail track, Mac and his team left the still-protesting engine and struck out for a mountain three kilometres to the south, from where they could monitor any recovery train FRELIMO sent to collect the remains of the one now languishing in the riverbed. Then they would climb down from their mountain and destroy that as well.  
As the sun came up, they could see right down from their mountain perch into the valley and could see another bridge not one kilometre from the destroyed one. It had not been marked on their maps and the intelligence people had known nothing of it.  
Had they known, Mac and his men could have destroyed both of them and the coaches would have been nicely marooned between the two demolished bridges, thereby doubling the time it would take FRELIMO to salvage them.  
When FRELIMO did come, they came in strength and were clever enough to send a train from both ends of the rail track, then deploy troops on either side of the line in a very wide extended line formation to look for the saboteurs. Luckily for them, no doubt acting on a tip-off from one of the passengers, they unearthed the SAS’s landmine.  
The prize was a diesel train, but there were FRELIMO troops milling around it all the time ... and Mac decided against hitting iL It was impossible to get out of the escarpment, effectively hit the train and get back into the escarpment safely again without encountering intense opposition from an extremely upset enemy. There were only twenty SAS operators and they would be sorely outnumbered by a heavily armed enemy.

Meanwhile, other plans were afoot to thwart ZANLA moving ammunition northwards by alternative means.  
As part of a three-pronged exercise to stop enemy ammunition getting into Rhodesia, a 12-man SAS group was in position along the road to Tete and awaiting the arrival of a ZANLA munitions truck.  
The intelligence coming in was that now the track had been sabotaged, resupplies were to be ferried up by road from Maputo... and that the convoy carrying them was due to reach Guru within a couple of days of the Mecito bridge being demolished.  
The SAS ambush party were waiting in the pouring rain for them ten kilometres north of Guru. It was a busy road and the ambushers lying low some fifty metres from the tar, remained undetected in the cover of the thick bush.  
At 05h00, five days after the rail bridge was demolished, Sergeant _Small Bez_ was sitting on guard in his bivvy when he heard a rumble in the distance. Unsure if it was a vehicle, he called for another opinion from the chaps on the hill above him.  
“Yes,” came the reply, “I can definitely hear vehicles; in fact I can see lights coming,” he was warned.  
It didn’t take long to get the action going... and soon an assortment of guns and rocket launchers were lined up along the edge of the road. A command-detonated landmine had already been buried in the tar road.  
At 05h30, the first vehicle came into sight It was still dark but the men in the bushes could see that it was a pantechnicon with huge green lights shining through the early-morning downpour. But it looked more like a civilian vehicle than a ZANLA one and they allowed it to get clear of the killing ground.  
Next came an open-backed truck bearing a group of men with tarpaulins pulled over their heads. They were huddled together for protection from the rain and cold and there could be no mistaking this for anything other than what it was - a ZANLA troop carrier.  
Corporal Rob Slingsby looked down the sights of his RPG-7 rocket launcher, and as the troop carrier crunched nearer, there was a bright flash and a tremendous bang as his rocket left the launcher and sped on its way.  
He hit it smack centre, sending it careering out of control... and straight towards him. He leapt out of the way in the nick of time, seconds before it hurtled passed hint It ploughed over one of his rockets, then crashed through the bush taking its petrified passengers on the final journey.  
The mission commander meanwhile had pressed the button to activate his hidden landmine and the third vehicle - a Land-Rover - went up in a huge bang and disintegrated into nothing.  
The explosions were enough to bring the twenty assorted trucks following behind to a grinding halt They did a quick U-turn and beat a hasty retreat, but they were spotted hiding in an orchard by a Lynx pilot... and at 08h30 when the clouds began to clear, the Hunters screamed in with all guns blazing and accounted for every vehicle that could be seen. Then a ZANLA petrol bowser which had gone unnoticed in the initial attack, caught one pilot’s eye and just before he peeled off home, he destroyed that as well.  
The huge mushroom that billowed into the sky as the explosion went off and the petrol ignited, was cleady visible to the SAS ambush group on their hill ten kiiometres (six miles) away.  
It was the end of that particular consignment of enemy ammunition... and, their mission complete, the ambush group returned to Rhodesia.  
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
Back on the mountain overlooking the demolished Mecito bridge, the SAS were still monitoring the activity of FRELIMO and their associated helpers. The enemy had eventually worked out how to overcome their problems until repair work could start and with the help of the not-so-willing locals, were operating a shuttle system offloading goods from a train on the south of the track and carrying them to one on the north, from where the goods were railed to Moatize.  
It was something that the Rhodesians were to remember. Next time, FRELIMO wouldn’t get the chance to be so clever ...
