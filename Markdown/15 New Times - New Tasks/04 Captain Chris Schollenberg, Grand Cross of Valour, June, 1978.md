Captain Chris Schollenberg - Schulie to his friends - the first SAS man to be awarded the Silver Cross of Rhodesia, earned a place in the world’s military history books by becoming the first holder of the Grand Cross of Valour, the country’s highest bravery award.  
The GCV, the equivalent of the Victoria Cross, or the Congressional Medal of Honour, was awarded to Schulie, then with the Selous Scouts’ Reconnaissance Troop, for “deeds of the most conspicuous gallantry and daring ... in which he exhibited extreme devotion to duty and courage of the highest order”.  
Schulie earned the honour for his very detailed reconnaissances of targets far behind enemy lines.  
Lieutenant-Colonel Ron Reid-Daly, the founding commander of the Scouts, had recommended Schulie for a bar to his Silver Cross, but the medals’ committee clearly felt that was insufficient tribute to the world’s foremost exponent of close-in reconnaissance.  
He was awarded the GCV, and after receiving his medal from the President of Rhodesia, some one and a half thousand men, the largest contingent of Selous Scouts ever assembled, broke into the Scouts’ specially-composed funeral song to pay their own tribute to Schulie. The African members of the unit regarded Schulie as a hero and said that no man who had done what he had done, ought still to be alive.
