By March, 1978, the political situation in Rhodesia had changed considerably. Following the ill-fated Geneva Conference and an unsuccessful bid to divide the PF leaders by embracing Nkomo, the need to bring about a political settlement had become critical.
The Anglo-American proposals were unacceptable to the Rhodesians - and the only option left was an internal settlement
On March 3, history was made. An internal political settlement was finally signed between Ian Smith and the three internal moderate blacks, Bishop Abel Muzorewa, Rev Ndabaningi Sithole and Senator Chief Jeremiah Chirau.
The thorny question of the number of white parliamentary seats was resolved, and it was agreed the whites would get 28 seats in the 100-seat government.
The white politicians had hoped for 34 seats, but even so, there were many Rhodesians who found it hard to believe that the internal blacks had agreed to so much (the Anglo-American proposals had only given the whites ten seats), and the agreement was hailed as a triumph of moderation.
There was to be a new constitution, which still had to be worked out ... a transitional government comprising an executive council of the four signatories to the March 3 Agreement ... and a ministerial council of black and white co-ministers, who were to share equal responsibility. Together they would work towards steering the country to black rule and, hopefully, peace. The first one-man-one-vote elections were to be held at Christmas and would produce the country’s first black Premier.
After eighty years of white rule, Rhodesia was about to enter a new era. Ian Smith, who had vowed there would be no majority rule in his lifetime, had successfully negotiated the white tribe into a position of a political minority. Even more amazing, the whites had given their blessing in a referendum.
The war had cost thousands of lives. Perhaps a political compromise could stop the killing. Even Britain’s Foreign Secretary, Dr David Owen heralded the agreement as a step in the right direction.
Yet the internal agreement was bitterly condemned by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe, and the black-white alliance only served to add a new dimension to the long war. Indeed, instead of the war being scaled down as had been hoped, it was to escalate.
By now, Nkomo had begun to build up his army and had thousands of trained men in Zambia ... and Special Branch desperately wanted something done to stem the increasing numbers of ZIPRA infiltrating from the north.
ZIPRA had established a new forward base, known as DK camp which was only a few kilometres inland from the Devil’s Gorge region of the Zambezi and an ideal crossing point. The river at that particular point was sluggish, easy to cross and only 100 metres from one unpopulated spot on the Zambian side to another unpopulated point on the Rhodesian bank. With two days’ hard march, the ZIPRA men could be in the heart of their support area in the Lupane region of Matabeleland.
The SAS attacked the camp, killed 27 enemy... and the landmines they planted on the access roads caused several casualties including Zambian army and police.
Within a month, ZIPRA had reorganised and established another base four kilometres further inland and again the SAS struck killing several ZIPRA, recovering 92 sophisticated Russian anti-tank mines - and pushing ZIPRA even further away from the Rhodesian border... until by June, ZIPRA were 32 kilometres (20 miles) from the Zambian shore.
Now the SAS and RLI planned to cause them more setbacks by continually harassing them ... killing or capturing them ... and locating their resting places and arms caches.
An SAS reconnaissance party had established that ZIPRA were now staging from the Kabanga Mission area (where there was a Zambian Army brigade HQ) ... moving through the night... stopping at the Simani semi-precious stone mine for equipment ... then heading southwards into Rhodesia.
From his hidden vantage point on a large hill overlooking Simani Mine, Mac McIntosh had reported numerous sightings and had seen ZIPRA milling around the staff compound before heading south towards Kariba.
Russian-made and supplied _Gaz_ and _Zil_ lorries had been seen transporting ZIPRA between Kabanga and Simani during the day.
However, despite the overwhelming evidence that the new DK set-up was somewhere in the Simani Mine area, the Rhodesians decided against going in and sorting them out immediately. Instead, they planned to ambush ZIPRA where they were most vulnerable - on the road between Kabanga and Simani. That way, they would not only account for dozens of ZIPRA, but would also destroy one or possibly more of their precious troop-carrying Russian lorries.
They were also hoping that, as a result of the ambush, there would be a build-up of ZIPRA at the suspected camp in the Simani Mine area. Then, having assembled all the various scatterings of ZIPRA in one place, they would swoop in for the kill with a RLI fireforce action.
But first, the ambush ...
The task was to go to “B” Squadron, at that time based with their tactical headquarters at Deka forward camp, a few kilometres from the northern border. They planned to plant a mine in the road between Kabanga Mission and Simani Mine, and to follow-up the resulting devastation with rifle, rocket and machinegun fire.
Their plan all hinged on their hidden landmine. It had to be powerful enough to destroy an enemy lorry, evening up the odds in the subsequent fire-fight.
Sergeant Major Pete Cole had the task of constructing a special landmine which had to be even more potent than normal. Using an existing landmine, he boosted its killing potential by removing all the unnecessary parts and filling every available space with additional plastic explosive. Then he converted it from a normal pressure mine which was detonated solely by the weight of a vehicle, to one he could control and set off at the touch of a button from his hiding place.
The landmine and detonators were to be buried in the middle of the road and connected to an electric cable running under the road surface and back to an exploder mechanism at his side. He chose a British-manufactured mechanism, which gave him the ability to test the wires, detonator and connectors from his ambush position without actually firing the mine. This was a crucial check, for, if the landmine failed to go off at the very moment they wanted it to, they stood the risk of compromising themselves and being overrun by the many enemy they were likely to encounter.
Just to make sure everything would go according to plan, he made a duplicate landmine, pressed the command button and the mine blew exactly as he hoped it would come the real thing.
The party was to consist of 12 men, commanded by Captain Pete Fritz. Eight men would form the main ambush/killer party ... and the others, led by Sergeant Phil Cripps, would be in an early-warning group passing on intelligence and covering their flank.
Just before last light on June 13, the operators got out the _Black-ls-Beautiful,_ and the usual green uniforms to make them look and pass for ZIPRA terrorists or Zambian soldiers... enabling them to pass for another terrorist or army group... giving them the initiative to get the first shot in if need be... or to move back into the bush and continue their task unsuspected.
Within minutes the transformation was complete and they packed their camouflage cream in their packs, for they would need it with them if they were to continue looking as black as the enemy.
They boarded three Alouettes and within thirty minutes the pilots were depositing them on the other side of the border. They were in Zambia once more and another mission had begun.
As the choppers and their crews flew back to base, the dozen SAS men quickly moved away from the landing zone. They lay-up in the thick bush near the road they were to use later that night, and remained hidden there for three-and-a-half hours without anyone making a sound.
They watched and listened, making sure that the old dirt road, overgrown and washed away in places, was not being used by anyone.
At last the commander, Pete Fritz, gave the order to move out. There was very little moon that night, which made walking on the old, rough road difficult, specially as they were weighed down with heavy packs, containing radios, medical equipment, ammunition, and enough food and water to last them for a ten-day stint in their ambush position.
For the next five-and-a-half hours, they trudged through the darkness. They did their best to forget the heat of the night and attempted to ignore the sweat that was mixing with the _Black-Is-Beautiful_, making their eyes sting and running into their mouths.
The journey was a slow, tedious business with many listening stops to check for locals, ZIPRA or Zambian soldiers, and they allowed themselves only a couple of rest breaks.
They were heading for a junction where the old road linked up with the Kabanga Mission-Simani Mine road. Once over the junction, they were to skirt around the bush, returning to the main road nearer Simani Mine.
As they neared the junction, progress became even slower, for the area they were enteringwas well populated with a number of kraals along the road. But apart from the occasional dogs barking as they passed the scatterings of huts, there was no other sign of life.
They were particularly careful not to leave spoor at the junction, and the two empty sandbags taken along for just that purpose made ideal stepping stones.
By 04h00, the ideal spot to lay up for the day had been found and the tired troops settled down to sleep in a thicket, leaving two men on guard. As dawn approached and the light gradually improved, they spread out in pairs and crawled deeper into the thick bush, which would give them protection from the heat of the day as well as from passing locals.
With one man able to sleep and the other awake and watching out, they had a fifty percent alert should anyone stumble into their position... which is precisely what happened later when a group of herdboys drove cattle right through their hideout The sleeping men were hurriedly shaken awake and everyone carefully eased himself further into the clumps of bushes to avoid detection.
The unsuspecting herdboys were within metres of a dozen camouflaged Rhodesians, who were busy dodging the occasional stone thrown to chivvy the cattle out of the bushes. The herdboys shrieked and belted their charges with sticks and the cattle crashed on their way through the bushes.
Pulses raced as the SAS feared detection, but fortunately, they remained unseen. All they had to really worry about after that were a number of very smelly deposits left nearby.
Later that afternoon the patrol continued on its way, making slow progress through the thick bush. By 23h00, they were tired enough to need a break. At 03h00, when there was a little more moon, they were off again, heading east and soon locating a stream which would lead them to the ambush area.
Leaving the others behind, a reconnaissance party struck out for high ground where, by the grey of first light, they selected the ambush positions.
The spot chosen for the killing ground was in a valley with the stream running through the centre and crossing the road. There was a suitable rocky area right next to the road where the ambush/killer group could hide before springing their attack... and fifty metres back from the road was a hill liberally scattered with boulders which were big enough to conceal them during the major part of their wait.
They selected another spot 800 metres to the west of the ambush group on a piece of high ground where the early-warning group would be able to see the road on either side of the ambush area.
The early-warning group moved off to begin their vigil while the eight men in the killer group took up their places among the rocks above the road.
At last, they all removed their packs, easing their sore shoulders and backs, already feeling the sweat starting to dry cold on their backs.
Everyone in the ambush group was told exactly where he had to go once the target appeared, and what he was expected to do. They established communications with the early-warning group and the signaller called up Deka base to report the ambush was now is position.

Sergeant Major Pete Cole and three men later moved down to the road to lay the landmine. With one man positioned on the road in either direction to warn of approaching traffic, the sergeant major and Corporal _Lucy_ set about chipping out the hardened soil with entrenching tools.
The road was made up of sand, stone, and rock... and it took them two-and-a-half hours to dig a hole deep enough to take the landmine. Then, just for good measure, 13 kilograms (29 lbs) of plastic explosive was added, making a total of more than 20 kilograms (44 lbs).
Once the landmine was laid and its wires buried as far as the nearby stream, they had to find a way to get the wires over the stream without getting them wet, and keeping them concealed. Pete decided to lay a log across the stream and run the wires along the side of it. Then he continued running the wires through the bush, camouflaging them as he went, back to a boulder in the ambush position from where the landmine would be detonated.
He connected the exploder to the wires and tested the circuit. A green light came on. Everything was working. The landmine would go off when he pressed the button. Now all they needed was a target.
At first light, he checked the camouflaging of the landmine, then the killer group rehearsed what they would do in the ambush. Captain Fritz and the sergeant major sited each man giving them their arcs of fire, and the sergeant major took note of a tree he could use as his aiming mark. When the first enemy vehicle reached the tree, it would be squarely over the landmine and pressing the button at that precise moment would achieve the best effect.
They returned to the LUP among the boulders on the hill to await a target It was to be a long wait, calling for extreme dedication.
ZIPRA lorries normally travelled the roads by day, but they had to be prepared to spring their ambush at any time. Someone had to sit by the radio around the clock to await the word from the early-warning group. Weapons and rockets had to be kept at the ready and ammunition pouches, grenades and other equipment essential for the ambush had to be worn constantly by day, and at their side by night.
As in all SAS ambushes, no one could ever speak above a whisper and often hand signals were the only means of communication. Equipment taken out of packs had to be replaced immediately it was used. Their small gas cookers had to be turned down low to avoid noise and there could be no cooking of strong-smelling food.
Smoking was strictly limited to certain times during the day. There could be little or no movement in the position and there was strict discipline regarding movement at night.
Water parties and men wishing to relieve themselves ventured out only at night and everyone made sure he told his colleagues exactly where he was going - a life-anddeath procedure, essential if he was to avoid being mistaken for an enemy blundering into the position and being shot
Only wooden spoons were used to avoid making a noise. All tins of food, mess tins and cookers were camouflaged with green paint. And before they set out they had checked that no one was carrying white handkerchiefs or shiny plastic bags - anything that could give the game away. All rubbish went in sandbags which they kept in their packs at all times.
There could be no washing at all. It was essential that their hands and faces remained blackened-up and they constantly had to renew their camouflage, checking each other for glimpses of pink flesh.
During their vigil there was a fair amount of local traffic... and the cyclists and pedestrians and the people in cars, lorries and Land-Rovers passed unaware of the 12 heavily armed ambushers lying in wait.
A meticulous log was kept of all movement, and from the type of clothing worn by some of the passengers, they assessed the Land-Rovers were ferrying ZIPRA.
Time passed slowly and with a fifty percent alert, the rest killed time by reading. Every book was camouflaged and passed from man-to-man in the main group. There were all types - spy books, westerns, thrillers... There were even war books, as if the real thing was not enough.
Another pastime with Pete Cole. Lieutenant Laurie Waiters and Corporal _Lucy_ was watching and feeding rock rats, welcome visitors seen only at first and last light.
The soldiers fed them on rice and bits of army biscuits and Laurie Waiters discovered they were specially partial to sugared peanuts.
The rats became quite tame, providing shows by chasing one another around the rocks and playing hide-and-seek with the soldiers and each other. Eventually, the men began to look forward to the break in routine provided by their new-found friends. Laurie Waiters talked of making a trap to catch them, but his superiors did not approve of his scheme.
Remaining under such conditions inside hostile country, surrounded by locals and under constant threat of discovery or worse, placed a great strain on everyone. As in all long-term ambushes, it called for a great deal of self-discipline, team work, give-and-take, patience, stamina, and above all the ability to wait.
By the fifth day, there was still no intelligence from the radio interceptors as to when a target might arrive, and they realised that they would either have to pull out in another four days or take a resupply of rations.
The commander opted for a resupply, and six men were chosen to rendezvous with the resupply chopper.
Two days passed and some time after last light, the six men carrying light weapons with enough rations and water for one day, and the tins and rubbish from all the ambush party, but otherwise empty packs, moved from the hill and down to the road.
Pete Cole, who would be leading the team, decided to use the road. It would be a risky business but there was no alternative.
Time was extremely limited and they had only one night to travel the 15 kilometres (nine miles) to the resupply point and find a safe position where they could hide up for the day to await the arrival of the chopper. Their return journey would also have to be completed in one night as it was essential to have the ambush group back to full strength as soon as possible.
They had just begun walking up the side of the hill when a vehicle suddenly shot over the crest of the other hill behind them. Quickly, they dived off the road, cradling their rifles to their chests, and lay still. Their hearts were pounding and they hoped that they had not been seen.
The lights of the vehicle were very dim. The soldiers lay perfectly still, listening and watching the lights without actually looking up.
They were about half way up the hill which was fairly steep, and as the vehicle slowly struggled up the incline, the soldiers tightened their grips on their rifles, then faced the road and slipped the safety catches to fire.
The vehicle came to a stop about four metres downhill from them and the lights were snuffed out. Pete Cole decided to chance it and see what was happening It was dark and the moon was not yet up. But the night glittered with a million stars and he could see three of his group were crawling into better cover.
The vehicle, a Land-Rover, contained about three or four men. One had a torch, it was the same Land-Rover they had logged going up and down the road and it obviously contained ZIPRA.
The light came on very dimly and the engine ticked over. The Land-Rover skidded, struggled, moved a few metres and stopped almost opposite the sergeant major. Then the lights went off.
The chap with the torch came from behind the Land-Rover. This is it, the Rhodesians thought Pete Cole sited through his nightscope, his finger was around the trigger.
But now he could see what the man was doing. Every time the Land-Rover stalled, he and his friends were placing large rocks under the rear wheels to prevent it rolling back down the hill.
They all appeared to be in civilian clothing and unarmed... and were far too busy trying to get their ailing vehicle up the hill to pay any attention to the sides of the road.
Off they went a few metres at a time, and had soon passed the men hidden in the bushes. They continued in this way up the hill, and on reaching the top, got in and drove off.
It had been a close shave all round. The late-night drivers would never know how close they had come to trouble.
The six SAS men returned to the road and continued towards the junction with the old road, the same one they had crossed over that first night a week ago.
Once again, they were careful not to leave spoor. It was not really a problem where the road was hard and dry and had been used by numerous pedestrians. But, even though they wore similar patterned boots to the locals, six sets of tracks through a muddy area might arouse suspicion and on a couple of occasions, they were forced to leave the road and by-pass muddy patches.
Eight hours after setting out the weary men reached the resupply area, and sought the sanctuary of a nearby hill... and later talked the pilot on to them, unloading the resupply and throwing their sandbags full of rubbish into the chopper at the same time.
Almost eight hours later, they arrived back in the target area, once more. The weary men were glad to get their packs off and grab an hour’s sleep before first light. The group was now back to full strength and ready for business.
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
Over in the early-warning position, Sergeant Phil Cripps and a lance corporal had been taking it in three-hour stints to keep watch on the road while two other men behind them provided protection. Their position was the best possible, but had limited views of the road.
At precisely 11h15 on June 24, eleven days after the mission had got underway. Sergeant Cripps was watching the road intently as usual, when, to his great astonishment around the corner swung a huge brand-new dark green Russian manufactured Zil truck.
Not only that but it was laden down with what looked very much like brand-new ZIPRA in crisp new khaki-coloured uniforms and floppy hats, carrying brand-new AK-47s.
Quickly, the excited sergeant got on the radio to the main ambush group.
“Here it comes,” he reported.
“How many trucks?” came the voice at the other end of the radio.
“Not sure,” the sergeant replied, “I only saw one.”
Down in the ambush group, books were hastily discarded, equipment fastened, weapons and rockets grabbed. Instinctively, they carried out their well-rehearsed drill of checking that everyone was ready, then they were up and running to take up their places in the ambush position.
The sergeant major tested the circuit. The green light came on. Everything was as it should be. They took off their safety catches and waited.
Meanwhile Sergeant Phil Cripps had returned from the radio to his earlier position and could see a truck on the stretch of the road that was visible through the bush. But now he couldn’t tell if it was the same truck he had already seen - or another one.
When another truck swung around the comer, the sergeant and his companion worked out that there had to be three trucks in all... and all carrying terrorists. Quickly, Phil relayed the information to the men in the ambush position.
“Well where are they’?” the ambush party demanded to know.
“I don’t know.” the equally-puzzled sergeant replied. “The engines keep stopping then starting up again. But they should have reached you by now.” Perhaps, he thought to himself, they had stopped for a smoke break.
To the group lying in wait. it seemed like an eternity. What should have taken only a couple of minutes took an agonising ten before the first Russian truck came into sight.
The convoy was moving cautiously and the ambush party could see why. There was a sweepline of ZIPRA troops walking ahead of the first truck and it was divided into two teams of four men on either side of the road.
They were checking the road for landmines and examining the sides of the road for the likes of the very people who were already primed and watching. The ambushers could clearly see machineguns on the first truck. All three lorries were crowded with enemy. Some were standing; some appeared to be sitting on what looked like equipment.
The sweepline advanced moving ever and dangerously nearer to the eight SAS soldiers lying in ambush behind the pile of rocks on the side of the road.
There were, in fact, not one but two dips in the road and, having meticulously swept through one looking for trouble, ZIPRA were obviously taken aback to find yet another ahead of them.
They decided that they had done enough checks for one day. They couldn’t be bothered with any more.
The sweepline halted just ten metres from the Rhodesian landmine. Then ZIPRA climbed on to the first truck and it moved off again. The other two trucks were now about 200 metres apart.
Corporal _Lucy_ with the RPG-7 rocket launcher and two companions had been tasked to take on the trucks in the event of the command-detonated landmine failing to do the job. _Lucy_ could not conceal himself satisfactorily and knelt by the road waiting to put a rocket into the truck.
The sergeant major meanwhile was watching his tree - his aiming mark - and the first vehicle. Stand by... prime... wait... wait... wait. Then the back of the truck passed over the hidden landmine.
A split second earlier, _Lucy’s_ companion shouted a warning to him that the enemy had seen him and were shooting at him. _Lucy_ sent a rocket into the vehicle.
But by then Captain Fritz had already given the word to initiate the ambush. The sergeant major pressed the button and that was it. The enemy didn’t have a hope.
There was a sudden wind-sucking _whoosh_ and the first truck vanished in a gigantic mushroom-shaped fireball of smoke and flames 15 metres in diameter. Amazingly, the ambush group never heard the explosion.
_Lucy’s_ rocket had merely added to the commotion of the moment. When he looked for the enemy who had been shooting at him a fraction of a second before, he had disappeared.
The size of the fireball came as a complete surprise to the ambush party. It was certainly nothing like the trial run back at Deka.
And no wonder. For there was more than ammunition exploding that day. The lorry had been carry a highly-inflammable cargo and as the landmine exploded it ignited the ammunition - and a 200-1itre drum of petrol.
The fireball was so enormous that for one horrifying moment the Rhodesians held their breath as they feared for the lives of _Lucy_ and party positioned a mere 15 metres from the detonation point.
But they were safe... and the moment the landmine detonated, _Lucy_ and his team jumped to their feet and put rockets into the two remaining trucks as fast as they could, while the remainder of the party raked the trucks with machinegun and rifle fire.
The second lorry was also carrying a 200-1itre drum of petrol and that too went up inflames as it ran into the wreck of the first truck, which was still burning, the exploding ammunition feeding the fire.
The driver of the third vehicle fled. The door was wide open as his truck careered down the hill and crashed into the other two, where it too immediately burst into flames.
The scene was an absolute holocaust. Trucks were blazing and exploding; there was the constant roar of gunfire and the air was filled with the screams of burning and wounded enemy.
All the ZIPRA on the first truck had been killed in the initial explosion. The ZIPRA men on the second and third vehicles attempted to flee in all directions. But they were either killed by the exploding ammunition or cut down by smallarms fire.
Several wounded managed to get clear and eventually staggered in to the Zambian Army base at Kabanga to report the ambush.
The ambushers had no concept of time but the event they had been waiting for so long to be played out must have only taken minutes.
The ambush group stopped firing and remained watching the area. The radio operator and a trooper moved back to the hill to report the ambush to Deka.
As the early-warning group moved in to join the main party, a burning figure stumbled towards them his flesh hanging in shreds. They shot him and he went down.
They rejoined the ambushers and swept the area, avoiding the immediate vicinity of the trucks which were burning and the ammunition still exploding.
Wounded enemy lying among rocks and thick clumps of bush opened fire, but the ZIPRA men were quickly outflanked and a further four were killed.
A body-count and search was carried out, documents and weapons were retrieved and photographs were taken of possible commanders and of the ambush site.
Their count, arrived at from the number of whole bodies plus parts of others, revealed that 69 ZIPRA had been killed. It was the highest kill-rate from any ambush in the entire war.
Pieces of bodies, arms, legs, chunks of flesh and intestines, even a rib cage, were hanging in the surrounding trees.
Charred bodies lay scattered in the surrounding undergrowth close to the trucks.
A line of dead was sprawled for 100 metres along the edge of the road, killed as they attempted to jump and run from the last two trucks as they careered out of control and into the ambush area.
A trail of new hats lay in a single line along the road, blown off by the force of the wind as the survivors ran away. They had kicked off their shoes as they fled... their hard bare feet better suited for running.
Every man had been in freshly-issued kit. They had even had new toothbrushes still in wrappers in their pockets.
As the explosions died down, all enemy weapons were recovered or thrown into the still-blazing trucks.
The SAS moved back to their former position on the hill to collect their packs. Suddenly, they saw the same burned terrorist who had been shot by the early-warning team get up and with super-human strength, stumble away from them. He was shot again. This time he did not get up.
A party was sent to lay landmines either side of the trucks in the hope of getting even more enemy when they came to investigate. Then, they regrouped and moved along the road to await extraction.
A group of Zambian civilians and their donkeys sauntered towards them, and, fearing the weight of the heavily-laden donkey cart might set off their new landmines, the soldiers detained them while they awaited the arrival of the choppers.
Soon the faint beat of rotors could be heard. The SAS released the locals with a warning not to go down the road. Then they slung their kit into the choppers and were gone.
Two choppers containing the main ambush group flew back to Deka ... but for Sergeant Phil Cripps and his team in the remaining chopper, there was still one more job to do.
They headed down the road towards Kabanga Mission and the pilot landed them far enough away from the ambush site not to arouse suspicion. They were near a kraal, so quickly moved into the bush and pulled back to the hills.
The Rhodesians were now planning to bait the big fish. They knew that the terrorist hierarchy made a practice of visiting the scenes of major incidents... but only after a few days’ grace during which the local army contingent checked the area for anything the Rhodesians might have left lying around.
That night, Phil Cripps’s mine-laying party moved back down the escarpment towards the road. It was a beer-drinking night in the local kraals and as the SAS men lurked in the bushes by the side of the road, they could hear a drunk stumbling along the road whistling and singing to himself.
The man blundered down the road and soon all fell silent again. The mine-party cautiously moved out into the road.
Aided by what little light there was from the poor moon that night. Corporal _Lucy_ set about digging a hole for the landmine, while two men kept watch either side of him.
Sergeant Phil Cripps was on hand to remove the excess soil and spread it among the bushes, but it was to be some time before he had any. The road was rock hard and Corporal _Lucy_ had to chip it out bit-by-bit with his bayonet. In normal conditions where the soil was in granular form, the job would only have taken an hour. This time it took him four, and by then his hands were cut and bleeding from his labours.
The hole he eventually carved was just large enough to take the mine and he wasn’t happy with it.
There was no space to put anything fancy like anti-prod devices or boosters. It would have to be just a straight-forward landmine.
The mine really needed to be deeper in the road and camouflaging it was not going to be easy. Vehicle tracks had been engraved into the dry hard road and it would be impossible to reproduce that sort of look.
Then _Lucy_ heard the sound of cows and had an idea. He knew that a huge pile of dung would provide the perfect solution. Better still he managed to find a suitably brittle piece that had been well and truly flattened by a passing vehicle. Carefully, he eased it on to his bivvy then carded it over to his mine. It fitted perfectly.
The sun was just coming up as he patted the cow dung in place. Soon, the locals would be up and about and maybe even the Zambian Army would be along to sweep the road for landmines.
They gathered up their kit and anti-tracked away...
Three days after the ambush, ZIPRA hierarchy and their bodyguards travelling in two Land-Rovers rolled along the road to carry out an on-site inspection of the devastation. Included in the VIP party was ZIPRA army commander Alfred Nkita Mangena... a big fish indeed.
Hidden under a piece of cow dung was the very thing, which, if activated, could strike fight at the heart of the enemy’s command structure.
But the two vehicles passed over the landmine uneventfully and the passengers continued on their way unharmed.
Their inspection over, the VIPs reversed and roared off in the direction they had come. Nothing untoward had happened on their way in. The Zambians had already swept up and down the road, checking the area out for landmines after all. There was every reason to feel confident on the way out.
But the Z1PRA men could not have been more mistaken. The rear wheel of the last Land-Rover bearing Alfred Mangena detonated the SAS landmine ... and the ZIPRA army commander and three of his colleagues went up in the blast... When the dust settled, it was found that in addition to the three dead men, six others, three of them senior commanders, had been injured.
Back at Deka, the SAS had been monitoring Zambian Army messages in the days after the ambush and when Captain Colin Willis heard the Zambian Army commander at Kabanga telling his HQ that the “comrades” had hit a second landmine, he scrambled the choppers, organised a small SAS stick and crossed the border once more in the hope of getting hold of Mangena’s body and claiming it as a propaganda prize. But by the time they got there, it had already been taken away.
It had certainly been a bad week for ZIPRA. Both the ambush and the landmine incident were major blows, and the death of Mangena was to hit the ZIPRA high command hard and have a demoralising effect on the men in the field.
Had Mangena survived, he would have gone on to be the most powerful man in ZIPRA next to Joshua Nkomo. According to SB thinking, his death was equivalent to having accounted for 1 000 run-of-the-mill enemy.
Mangena’s death was to cause considerable friction between ZIPRA and the Zambian Army. Z1PRA blamed the Zambians for it They were supposed to have checked out the road after all. They even accused the army of calling in the Rhodesians.
The Zambian Army very reluctantly cleared up the ZIPRA corpses and eventually convinced the local Africans to help them bury the bodies and remains. The burntout shells of the trucks were never removed and fight until the last days of the war they were still there, serving as a reminder to ZIPRA of what might befall them if they strayed too close to the border.

In the days following Mangena’s death, SAS reconnaissance groups reported numerous sightings of ZIPRA in the Simani Mine area... and Captain Colin Willis and Captain Fred Watt of 1 Commando, RLI, decided that the time had come to go into the mine complex itself.
They planned a vertical fireforce envelopment in the hope of flushing out ZIPRA ... and while Fred Watt remained airborne in a K-car directing movements in the sweep operations, Colin and a small SAS party were put down to pay the mine manager a visit. They were not the most welcome callers.

Not only was the elderly miner petrified about his fate at the hands of the Rhodesians, he was equally concerned about what would happen to him in the event he survived his ordeal. He was quite convinced that if ZIPRA came to interrogate him, they would kill him for assisting the Rhodesians.
He confirmed ZIPRA were moving around the area although they were not actually using any of the mine buildings.
Then between them they concocted a plan to protect the miner from reprisals. The SAS stressed they didn’t want to harm him in any way, but if he wanted to avoid trouble with ZIPRA, they would have to make out they were assaulting him to force information from him. After that, they would tie him up but would do it in such a fashion that he would be able to free his bonds within half an hour of their leaving.
The miner agreed and gave a command performance for the benefit of his staff outside. His blood-curdling screams sounded realistic as the SAS proceeded to thump the table and kick the sides of his desk to get some genuine beating sounds. Occasionally, the SAS men yelled back at him then wacked the table a bit harder.
But time was getting short and they still had to search the mine and Colin decided to speed things up by borrowing the manager’s private Landcruiser.
Assuring the miner that they had no intention of stealing his vehicle, they promised to repatriate his keys by dropping them on his lawn from the chopper.
Their search failed to turn up any ZIPRA however and as they flew over the manager’s house, saw he had failed to keep his part of the bargain to remain fettered until they left.
Obviously not believing a word they said about not returning his vehicle, he had already freed himself and was running around outside in a state of panic. Colin tossed the keys out of the chopper and after satisfying themselves the miner had seen them, the Rhodesians disappeared back over the border.
This particular phase of the operation was unproductive and, as a direct result of the ambush and the Mangena episode, the area went quiet, as ZIPRA had once again been pushed further away from the border.
