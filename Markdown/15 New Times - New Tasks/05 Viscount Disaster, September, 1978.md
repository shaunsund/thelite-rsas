It was Sunday, September 3. A day Rhodesia would never forget.  
It was the day the many faces of terrorism suddenly took on a new ghastliness.  
Joshua Nkomo, accused by rival Robert Mugabe of not being aggressive enough, was, in a single day, about to correct that impression.  
A firing mechanism found at Victoria Falls Airport some time before was the first indication the security forces had that a new dimension was about to be added to the long, bitter war.  
It belonged to a SAM-7 missile launcher (commonly known as a Strela), a Russian hand-held weapon which fired a surface-to-air heat-seeking missile that could zero in on an aircraft’s engine with devastating effect. Later, part of a second SAM-7 was found.  
Both Strelas had been fired at South African Airways flights but something had gone wrong with them and they had missed ... and two plane loads of tourists continued their journey unaware of just how lucky they had been.  
They were the first attempts of aggression against civilian aircraft and the incidents were hushed up. Only a handful of security force people knew about them.  
ZIPRA was not amused that the holiday makers had escaped with their lives. They accused their Russian backers, who had supplied the missiles, of tampering with them and making them ineffective. A Russian technician was immediately sent to Lusaka to examine the Strelas still held there and he came to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with them. If they were not functioning properly, it was ZIPRA’s own fault, he said.  
They were obviously transporting them too roughly to the war zone: if they wanted results, they would just have to be more careful.

Shortly afterwards, a planeload of suntanned holiday makers who had been spending a relaxing weekend break at Kariba boarded an unarmed Air Rhodesia Flight RH 825, the Viscount _Hunyani_ for the return journey to Salisbury.  
Despite the war, the lakeside holiday resort had continued to flourish and Kariba remained a tourists’ paradise of game-viewing, water sports, fishing, evenings in the casino, and unmatched sunsets.  
It was a retreat to fly to. Air travel was the best way to go: everyone knew that. It was far safer than travelling by road, which carried all the risks of hitting a landmine or being ambushed.  
Within minutes, the 58 passengers and crew had left Kariba and the great manmade lake dividing Rhodesia from Zambia was behind them. They were still climbing, flying over the endless scrub and remote, sparsely populated bush that made up the vast Urungwe Tribal Trust Land.  
In an hour, they would be back in the capital. But first there was a sundowner to look forward to on the plane to round off their break in routine. Children were laughing and hostesses Brenda Ann Pearson and Dulcie Esterhuizen were handing around the drinks.  
Then, just minutes out of the airport, disaster struck.  
Something smashed into two of the plane’s four engines with a thud, violently shaking the Viscount. Flames streamed past the windows: pieces of metal pinged off the skin of the aircraft.  
One of Nkomo’s Russian-supplied deadly heat-seeking missiles had finally found its mark, its infra-red guidance control automatically homing in on the heat given off by the still-climbing Viscount.  
It struck the trailing edge of the jet pipe of the number three engine, spraying shrapnel into the wing and shattering the fuel pipe. Its incendiary device started a fierce fire in the wheel well, which was filled with spilled fuel.  
“I can’t... ” First Officer Garth Beaumont said in part of a message picked up by a National Parks plane at 17h11. The rest of the message was never heard.  
A minute later, Kariba Airport picked up his desperate May Day signal.  
“I’ve lost both starboard motors, we are going in …”  
Inside the cabin, one man jumped up and dashed along the aisle shouting for a fire extinguisher, another tried to get through a window as the plane nosedived. One wing was already in flames.  
Calmly, gallantly, a hostess instructed the frightened passengers to fasten their seatbelts and put their heads between their knees. Captain John Hood spoke over the intercom, telling them to brace themselves for a forced landing.  
They were heading for a clearing in the thickly-treed terrain. It looked like a cotton field. Miraculously, the captain crash-landed his stricken Viscount. putting it down almost like a feather. But before he could stop it, the Viscount ploughed into a deep concealed ditch dividing the field. The fight wing hit two trees, tearing portions off the wing tip, and the plane disintegrated.  
An intense fire broke out, consuming everything that was burnable.  
Air Rhodesia Flight 825 was over.

In Salisbury, relatives who had gone to meet the flight were told to go home. The plane had left Kafiba on time but there was no news of it. The airport would let them know the moment they heard anything.  
Not far away, the telephone jangled discordantly at SAS Major Garth Barrett’s home in the suburbs.  
It was ComOps. Could the SAS Commanding Officer put some “paramedics” as the caller described them, on standby and ready for an immediate operation? When pressed for a reason, the voice at the other end of the telephone told him that a Viscount was missing.  
After an exchange in which the ComOps man refused to say what the cause of the plane’s disappearance was, and did not accept Barrett’s theory that it had been shot down or that the incident was a terrorist action, the SAS CO agreed to provide a small tracker and medical team.  
An hour after the distress message had gone out from the stricken plane, a series of telephone calls were made to the SAS to “get into camp as soon as possible.” All told, twenty men were rounded up, including two doctors, an operational medic, an officer skilled at tracking, and RSM Pete Allan.  
Garth Barrett quickly put them in the picture. The doctors helped supervise the packing of five panniers of kit - slatted wooden boxes designed to break open on impact with the ground. Everything that could possibly be needed for a casualty station was packed.  
About 22h00, the CO told them to fall out. There was nothing more they could do. They had better go home and report to New Sarum at 05h00 next day, he said.  
There was to be no sleep for the relatives and friends of the missing passengers and crew. As one long hour followed another, there was still no news of the Viscount or its 58 passengers and crew.  
Air traffic controllers at Kariba were convinced it had been hit by a Strela and that there would be a fire on board. An aerial grid pattern search was conducted throughout the night but there were so many fires from locals in the TTLs that it was impossible to identify any as a plane burning.  
The morning paper and radio carried reports of the missing plane. It seemed the whole country either knew someone on the plane, or knew someone who did. In a country with a small European population equivalent to that of an average British town, it was hardly surprising.  
A special edition of the paper would be put out as soon as further details were known, readers were told. Journalists began ferreting for stories and pictures of the missing crew and passengers. The rest of Rhodesia hoped and waited.  
Meanwhile, somewhere low over the Urungwe TTL, a Dakota containing the SAS medical/tracker team was circling searching the rugged, densely-treed terrain for anything that might give them a lead.  
It was extremely hot and the Dak was flying at just 1 000 feet. Most of the men were violently sick from the turbulence.  
Then, as they reached the end of their grid search, Garth Barrett and the pilot spotted the wreck of the missing plane. It was still smouldering and even from the air it was obvious that there had been a vast amount of devastation. The plane was broken up and most of it had been completely burned out.  
The CO passed the news to the SAS paratroopers in the back. Another message was flashed to ComOps.  
They did several low-level circuits and Garth Barrett saw a group of bodies lying under some trees.  
Inside the plane the grim-faced SAS waited for the cue that would come any minute now. They stood up, checked their equipment and shuffled systematically towards the open door.  
First came the red light. Then the green. As the first stick jumped out, the sudden rush of wind tore at their faces and uniforms making a pleasant change from the hot stifling atmosphere inside the Dakota.  
As they floated down, they could see the wreckage strewn around the cotton field and the scorched earth near the fuselage.  
The CO, Garth Barrett, medic Bruce Langley, RSM Pete Allan and a fourth man climbed out of their harnesses, grouped together and moved forward. Then they stopped in their tracks, confronted by an appalling sight they knew they would never forget.  
There was a bundle of bodies, ten in all, the same ones seen from the air. A little boy ... a middle-aged woman, an old man with twenty dollars sticking out of his pocket… the air hostesses, one of them, the sister of an SAS soldier, the girlfriend of another...  
Their injuries told a gruesome story. Somehow, these ten had survived the horror of the crash. Then they had been mowed down by automatic rifle fire from close range at the hands of a separate gang of ZIPRA.  
The hardened SAS men who had witnessed death in many a battle, could only gape in horror at the scene… while the Dakota circled overhead dropping the other parachute stick.  
While some of the SAS quickly encircled the crash site, the first stick moved off to search for other victims.  
Then they saw a white hand wave at them… and three people popped out of the bush at the bottom of the field.  
For a moment, the soldiers could hardly believe it. After what they had just witnessed, they were not expecting to find any survivors.  
They sprinted forward to help them, and as he ran, medic Bruce Langley shouted across asking if anyone was injured. Amazingly, there were no broken bones.  
The three survivors were a honeymoon couple… and Anthony Hill, a close friend of RSM Pete Allan. It must have indeed been a comforting sight to Mr Hill to see a familiar face coming down the track… and the SAS man had soon brewed up a cup of tea for his friend.  
Bruce Langley set up his stove and made the bride coffee. She gulped it down in one go. Some of her clothes had been torn away in the shock of the blast and someone organised a blanket for her.  
Bit by bit, the survivors told what had happened… of how they had escaped from the broken wreck, helping some of the injured to safety. They returned to look for warm clothing and blankets and were searching the luggage when a group of terrorists arrived carrying AKs.  
“Don’t worry,” the ZIPRA men had shouted. “We won’t harm you,”… and they laughed as they ran towards the wreckage.  
At first, some of the survivors thought they had come to help them. Some were even thanking them. But then ZIPRA suddenly turned on them and mowed them down.  
The three survivors ran towards a ridge. As the bridegroom ducked to retrieve his wife’s dropped wedding ring, the attackers fired over his head.  
Five other survivors, including a four-year-old girl, had also crawled to safety from the wreckage but were searching for water when ZIPRA arrived. They heard the shots and fled into the bush.  
Of the 58 passengers and crew, 18 had escaped from the wreckage and ten of them were massacred.  
Another grisly scene confronted the soldiers at the wreck. The charred bodies of children lay outside the plane. A doll was lying forlornly under the baking African sun and would never be played with again.  
As for the passengers in the plane, they had never stood a chance. The horror of it all cannot be imagined. The heat from the smouldering plane was intense. The stench of burned fuselage, molten rubber, synthetic fabric and death, hung in the air.  
Realising there was nothing much that they could do to help the survivors, some of the soldiers went off and sat in the riverbed. A couple chose to sit quietly on their own and make themselves a cup of coffee.  
By now other security forces began arriving from Karoi to search for the five other survivors still wandering the bush and they were soon picked up.  
Scores of angry farmers joined the hunt for the men responsible.  
A nursing sister arrived by helicopter and went hysterical at the incredible scene.  
Two minutes later she was on her way out again.  
The SAS men had played their part and flew home. The ghost of flight RH 825 would haunt them and Rhodesians for always.  
In a BBC interview, Joshua Nkomo proudly took credit for the Viscount disaster. _The Fat Man_ cackled as he boasted that it had been ZIPRA who had shot down the plane. He denied they had killed the survivors, but Dr Callistus Ndlhovo the ZAPU man at the UN, admitted ZIPRA had killed the survivors ... but not the children.  
In his autobiography, Nkomo said that while his men helped the survivors to safety and took them water, “I have no idea how the ten died. I do not believe they were killed by our people. I hope not.”  
A few weeks earlier Ian Smith had offered Nkomo the hand of friendship and some power-sharing in the transitional government at a secret meeting in Lusaka. Nkomo was always viewed as the lesser of the two evils, but there was no way Nkomo - after the incident Ian Smith called him a “monster” - could be welcomed back.  
Rhodesians were beside themselves with anger at the ruthless and cowardly outrage. The country mourned and morale plummeted to new depths. The mood was not helped by inaccurate reports in South Africa that the white victims had been raped before being shot.  
Outspoken MP Mr Bill Irvine said the slaughter of the injured and dazed survivors was an action more barbaric than anything in the annals of Ghengis Khan.  
“The people of this country will not let these innocents go unavenged... I can promise the leaders of the PF skulking in Lusaka and elsewhere that those who seek to ride the wind, will reap the whirlwind.”  
In South Africa, the Friends of Rhodesia Society offered a reward of one hundred thousand rand to anyone who could bring the murderous Nkomo back to Salisbury for trial. No one collected the reward.  
The trip to Lusaka to capture Nkomo was not necessary either. For amazing as it may seem, Nkomo was having dinner with white friends in the exclusive Salisbury suburb of Highlands two days after the tragedy.  
A memorial service was held in Salisbury’s Anglican Cathedral five days after the atrocity and was attended by some of the survivors. The church had never been fuller and the 2 500 mourners had to queue to get inside. There was not enough room for all of them and 500 had to stand outside.  
Passers-by wept as they walked past the grim silent crowd. The SAS men who had found the broken, burnt and butchered bodies were there, too, to pay their last respects to the victims.  
Within a few years, the Russians would shoot down a South Korean plane carrying 269 innocent passengers. The western world would be united in its condemnation of such a barbaric act. But there was no such reaction to the Rhodesian atrocity.  
Only, as the Dean of Salisbury’s Anglican Cathedral. John de Costa, pointed out, a “deafening silence”.  
“... Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the crash of the Viscount _Hunyani_... this _bestiality_, worse than anything in recent history, _stinks_ in the nostrils of Heaven. But, are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised? We are not Like men in the story of the good Samaritan, they pass by on the other side.”  
There had been no loud condemnation by Britain’s Dr David Owen, nor from the President of the United States, or the Pope, the Chief Rabbi, or the Archbishop of Canterbury, he said in his sermon.  
Blame lay not only with those who fired the guns, but also with the United Nations and their church equivalent the World Council of Churches”… from the safety and comfort of New York and Geneva, high moral attitudes can safely be struck. For us in the sweat, the blood, the suffering, it is somewhat different.  
“... The ghastliness of this ill-fated flight from Kariba will be burned upon our memories for years to come.”

Within a couple of months, the tracker who had been in the team which had found the wreck of the Viscount returned to Urungwe ostensibly to run an SAS officer selection course. However, while there, he used their skills to ambush known paths in the hope of getting some of the men responsible for the Viscount episode. After a tipoff, the SAS accounted for three of the men responsible for killing the survivors.  
Five months later, a second Viscount was downed. Again, the SAS were called in to help. Then they were told the panic was over. Their services were not needed. This time everyone on board had perished ...
