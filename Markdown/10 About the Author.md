While it is unusual for a woman to write a military history, this is not the first time a woman has written about the SAS. Virginia Cowles wrote the much-acclaimed _Phantom Major_, the story of the SAS founder, David Stirling and the SAS’s beginnings in the Western Desert.
Barbara Cole has worked on newspapers and magazines in Britain, Rhodesia and South Africa, specializing in court work and human interest affairs. She was a High Court reporter for the _Rhodesia Herald_ at the start of Operation _Hurricane_ and in that capacity saw many an insurgent, albeit from the safety of the Press bench.
Barbara was the news editor on the controversial _Zimbabwe Times_ during the interesting days of change in 1978 and later worked for the publications department of the Rhodesian Ministry of Information, helping to distribute those dreaded wartime communiques:
“Combined Operations Headquarters regrets to announce…”
She gave up her career with a South African publishing company to concentrate on researching and compiling the history of the Rhodesian SAS, one of the most interesting and fascinating stories to come out of the Rhodesian bush war. It took several years and despite many hurdles, Barbara was able to track down some hundreds of SAS men now dispersed in many countries around the world and get them to tell their tales. The fact that secrecy is a way of life with SAS men, makes this all the more remarkable.
