Meanwhile, “A” Troop Commander, Captain Bob McKenna, had been looking at different ways of getting into Tete undetected - and remaining so.
Whenever a Dakota took men into Mozambique, there was always a chance of their being seen by the enemy despite diversionary tactics adopted by the pilots. Walking around the bush playing cat-and-mouse games with ZANLA and FRELIMO also had severe limitations.
What they wanted was a foolproof way of outfoxing the enemy. They needed to infiltrate undetected, strike and melt into the night... then pop up again elsewhere to mount another attack, with the enemy not knowing where they came from or went to - or where they were likely to hit next.
Ideally, what they needed was somewhere safe to operate from. And some sort of transport to get them from one target to the next.
Vehicles were obviously out. They could not run around Mozambique in them for long and still remain undetected.
Then Bob turned his attentions to the giant Lake Cabora Bassa, one of the biggest man-made lakes in the world straddling north-west Fete Province and formed a few years earlier by damming the Zambezi at the Cabora Bassa Gorge.
When Bob studied his map, he knew the lake offered endless possibilities. To the south of the lake and a few nights’ march inland were Daque, Mague and Chinhanda Crossroads - the very infdtration routes the SAS wanted to hit and there were FRELIMO targets to the north, too.
The lake was about 250 kilometres (155 miles) long and as much as fifty kilometres (31 miles) wide in places depending on the rains. It was a vast area and there could be enormous problems. But surely it made sense to include the lake in the overall strategy, use it as a firm base and put an SAS team on it?
They could base up on shore or on one of the rocky islands during the day, attack the enemy on their own territory at night, using ZANLA’s own hit-and-run tactics of landmining and ambushing. Then, they could return to the sanctuary of the giant lake and canoe on to their next hiding place.
The enemy would never dream of looking for them on the lake, not when the Rhodesians could get to the target areas by other, far simpler means.
The lake offered them both mobility and refuge and it was agreed at SAS headquarters that Bob McKenna should lead an operation on the lake.
The idea was that Bob and his team of _Cockleshell Heroes_ were to disrupt road traffic on the Tete-Mague-Mkumbura road and harass ZANLA and their FRELIMO supporters whenever they could find them.
All told, 12 “A” Troop men were selected to experience the novelty of the very first lake op on Cabora Bassa. Every man was thrilled at having been chosen; delighted at the prospect of operating from the lake and of pioneering a new concept. There was a bit of apprehension, too, as there always was about the unknown.
But perhaps the most excited man of all was territorial trooper Dave Arkwright. For years, Dave had dreamed of gaining a first-hand knowledge of the massive lake. As a university student, he had intended doing a thesis on Cabora Bassa for his town planning degree. It would have meant walking right around the lake, a mammoth undertaking indeed.
But the war had interfered with his plans, A white man - and a Rhodesian at that - strolling around Cabora Bassa in the heart of enemy country would have been most unwelcome, not to mention a wonderful target or a propaganda prize. Dave was forced to forget his dream of seeing the lake and had to choose another project.
But now, when he had given up all thoughts of ever seeing the lake, he had suddenly been given the chance to see much more of it than he had ever thought possible. He would not have to walk either. It remained to be seen if six weeks of paddling would cure his fascination!
Rehearsals as always, were the time-tested secret of success, and the canoes from which they were to live and operate for six weeks were taken out to Lake McIllwaine, near Salisbury, to iron out possible problems.
The 12 men soon found that their personal kit would have to be minimal. With two people to a canoe, there was little room left once they squeezed themselves in with their weapons and equipment, much of which had to be made waterproof to prevent it becoming useless.
Resupplies - food, ammunition, canoe spares, equipment - were to be parachuted in to them by Dakota. They also planned to boost their ammunition supplies by capturing enemy equipment.
The clandestine canoeists were to be in daily contact with the SAS HQ back at Salisbury and special codes had to be worked out for every single canoe part to avoid lengthy messages when ordering spares.
Eventually, Captain McKenna and his team were ready and on January 17 they set off for the long drive to the north-eastern border. They were going to infiltrate to the lake by way of the Musengezi River near the Musengezi Mission in Rhodesia. It was the most devious, the most surreptitious access they could have chosen. It would take them a full day to reach their starting point, but far better that than being choppered in, risking being seen before they could start operations.
They broke their journey with a stop-over at the Centenary forces canteen, then it was on to the Musengezi, a long laborious journey, much of it spent on a dirt road, always a hazardous business with its attendant risks of landmines.
A final six kilometre cross-country ride through the bush brought them to a lonely spot at the river’s edge and to the start of their operation.
As they climbed from their truck they were hot, dusty and more than a little tired and stiff. Then they assembled their canoes and packed in their equipment. For they were to be on their way immediately and planned to paddle down the Musengezi River and be on Cabora Bassa by the early hours of the following day.
They donned their regalia of war - their green terrorist-type uniforms - some pulling on leather gloves to protect their hands from the rigours ahead.
They then checked out their weapons, the usual assortment of AKs, FNs, RPDs and an RPG-7 rocket launcher. Every man carried a pistol in a shoulder holster, so that should his canoe capsize and he become separated from the main weapons, he would still be armed.
It was 18h00 and still light when they stepped into their heavily-laden canoes.
The red half-ball of the sinking sun filtered through the bush at the rivers’ edge and danced on the water as they pushed off for terrorist country. The peaceful beauty of a Rhodesian sunset was unmatched anywhere... and the war seemed a very long way from such a tranquil scene.
Along the muddy banks of the narrow river were the unmistakable shapes of crocodiles sleeping in the dying heat of the day. The canoeists sitting very low in the water were taking no chances and kept a very cautious eye on the crocs as they drifted and gently paddled by in single file.
The crocs did not seem to hear the silent approach. Softly, the paddles brushed the water as the flotilla continued on its way. Suddenly, first one, then another croc woke up, caught sight of the intruders and dashed headlong into the river.
But they harboured no evil intentions. They had merely been startled by the canoeists’ sudden appearance and only wanted to get into the comparative safety of the muddy waters to hide from the strange new creatures in their territory.
There were encounters too with leaping fish which hit them on the head and landed on their laps. Then, disaster.
As they rounded a bend, they were whipped away, spinning and crashing into a set of rapids, hitting trees, then sinking. Canoe structures were broken, kit and equipment were soaked. There was to be no going on that night, if indeed at all.
They settled down for the night, and next morning set to in earnest patching and repairing canoe frames and drying out clothes and equipment.
Fortunately nothing important had been lost and the radios were all working with Salisbury-strength five, the maximum strength.
The weather was hot enough to dry out every item and at 18h00 on the second night of the op they set off again, but their journey was impeded by a lone hippo, snorting and snuffling to himself as he stood guard over his domain, determined not to let them through a particularly narrow stretch of the river.
The paddlers had only one option if they wanted to get on to the lake. They had to land and start the laborious time-consuming task of portering their canoes and equipment around the resolute beast - it was an enormous task. and all for a hippo.
Later, they witnessed a fascinating phenomenon when thousands of silver fish came advancing towards them, leaping and battling their way upstream, passing them in the night like a huge silver wave. Then they were gone and all was silent again…
At last, they paddled through the mouth of the Musengezi to the very edge of Lake Cabora Bassa,
Immediately there were problems with large patches of reeds, and canoes getting lost and it became necessary to follow the main course of the river until 22h00 when they were able to turn and travel in the direction they wanted to go.
The wind was now against them and the going was hard. A lion was making a terrible racket but it was far enough away not to worry them. They bumped along negotiating the clumps of dead reeds, careful not to make any unnecessary noise.
The last hour of their journey was spent paddling through a couple of kilometres of partially submerged mopani forest as they looked for land. By now everyone was tired and stiff.
At 03h00 they reached land at last. Or at least mud. But it had been a long night and they were glad to be even on that muddy, smelly piece of land, surrounded by its evil looking water.
![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
Next day, they put up bivvies for shade from the blistering sun as there was no natural shade anywhere near their base. All around was mud and desolation. Hundreds of trees reached forlornly out of the water near the shores, a legacy from the pre-lake days. There was no way of describing the atrocious smell of the once magnificent mopani forest now drowned and putrifying.
The sunset over the peaceful lake was incredible. And the stark surroundings and mountains looking as if they had been chiselled from a giant slab of marble, gave the canoeists the uncanny feeling of having been suddenly transported back to the Stone Age where time stood still.
Captain McKenna established radio communication with SAS Intelligence Officer Scotty McCormack flying somewhere over Tete Province. It was reassuring to think that someone was thinking of them, Bob mused. They were very conscious of being a long way from home and help, very much on their own, and if anything untoward were to happen, there would be no immediate back-up, no prompt casualty evacuation.
Their first resupply was due a few nights later... and they called the Dakota pilot up ten minutes before his drop time. Five minutes later they spoke to him again.
He was flying with his navigational lights off and they talked him on to them by the sound of his engines. Above, the pilot looked for the twinkle of their strobe lights flashing down below in the darkness. Then the SAS saw the silhouette of the resupply plane against the backdrop of stars.
“Left ... left ... green light on ... NOW,” Bob McKenna instructed ... and the parachute with its box of supplies fell into the black night from 800 feet.
The Dakota turned and set course for home, leaving the dozen men to their own devices on the dark, desolate lake below.
It had been a good drop and their resupply had landed just twenty metres away from them, although it took them all of 45 minutes to scramble over the rocks and obstacles to retrieve it.
The kitchen staff at SAS HQ had done them proud. There were freshly cooked chickens still warm in tin foil, oranges, bread rolls and milk. It made a pleasant change from their usual tins of sausages, baked beans, nuts and boiled sweets. They felt very privileged. Sometimes it paid being in special forces ...
The main purpose of the drop however, had been to enable them to establish an ammunition dump with additional landmines and rockets from Salisbury. But someone forgot to send the ammunition and Bob had to make a slight change of plan.
They forgot the cigarettes, too, so the smokers would have to go easy there.
Their feast over, they buried the parachute and its harness together with some batteries, biscuits and a bottle of rum. They would return and recover them later.
![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
The operation had been underway a week and a four-man patrol led by Colour Sergeant Karl Lutz now prepared to venture out to get on with the business of fighting the war.
The four operators exchanged their sandals for walking boots and were dropped on the mainland at 17hl5. They were to trek inland to the Mague-Caponda road to leave a surprise on the ZANLA infiltration route snaking its way through the bush to Rhodesia.
Back on the lake their friends waited for their return. It was as hot as hell on their little island — 37°C (100°F), an unbearable situation made worse by the lack of natural shade.
Pete Cole’s log read: “We have allowed the guys to sit in the lake to keep cool. But the lake water is also hot: so hot in fact that the captain cooked his instant rice by leaving it in the water. He said it was okay. It must have been his day, as for the first time since we started out the tube of milk he used for his tea was not off.”
Morale was good although the smokes were running low. There was still enough food for another week but as someone had forgotten to send the gas cylinders in the resupply, there was not enough fuel to cook it with and the use of wood fires was ruled out because of the giveaway smoke.
Towards dark the following day, the men on the lake saw a green flare shoot into the night over on the mainland. It was Karl Lutz and company, back from their landmining foray, unable to attract the attention of the rest of the paddlers with their out-of-order radio.
Their colleagues hastened to recover them and learned that they had been forced to return barefoot to avoid leaving boot spoor on the dirt roads. The commander decided to give them a few hours to rest their sore and blistered feet and catch up on their sleep, but at 03h00 it was back in their canoes to spend a very long time crashing and manoeuvring around the mopani forest
They were still able to cover ten kilometres before sunrise, stopping in the midst of a swamp on another muddy smelly island just two feet above the waterline. The trees were draped with moss and weed and it was all rather eerie. It could easily have doubled for the Florida Everglades, they agreed.
At 09hl5, a loud explosion rolled across the Mozambican countryside. It could only be Karl Lutz’s landmine. “’First blood to us,” the commander logged. It was nice to know the op had started in earnest. Intercepts later reported that the 21C of Mkumbura FRELIMO garrison had been killed in the blast.
“We are trying to read books but it’s much too hot even for that,” Pete Cole logged. “I went and sat in the water for a while, but it’s so warm and dirty, it’s not much help. I was glad when it started to get dark and we could be moving. I also buried the remains of my gloves today. They were completely worn out but I think my hands are hard enough not to need them any more.”
Within a few days, ten of the _Cockleshell Heroes_ had left the lake on another mission. Leaving sentries to guard the camouflage canoes, they set off to the road halfway between Mague and Daque, which even by Mozambican standards was in poor condition. There was very little vehicle and no pedestrian spoor.
Bob McKenna, Pete Cole and Karl Lutz who carried out a reconnaissance of the road agreed to move further east to find a good ambush site. Having found one, they showed each man where he was to be positioned during the ambush.
Then, when everyone was satisfied where he had to go, they moved back into the bush where there was more cover and more natural shade and where they could hide until a target appeared.
With weapons ready and two men on stag at a time, they remained in their position among the bushes for nine hours. Finally. their wait was over. The sound of a vehicle could be heard approaching.
Immediately they leapt to their feet, eager to do battle at last snatching up their weapons and racing to their pre-arranged positions 14 metres from the road.
A new Land-Rover was approaching It seemed loaded down and because of the state of the road was not travelling fast.
In the bushes the ten blackened-up men waited expectantly, every index finger curled around a trigger.
The Land-Rover bumped along.
Bob McKenna and Pete Cole were to give the signal by opening fire. Their FN rifles were fitted with Trilux scopes, making their targets look that much closer. They could not miss at that range and as the truck drew level, Bob picked off the driver and Pete shot the first passenger.
The others joined in immediately. There was a roar from the SAS weapons... and the Land-Rover hurtled off the road and crashed headlong into the bushes with bodies being flung off the back as the rounds slammed into them.
The ambushers moved forward, cautiously covering each other and checked out the occupants of the vehicle. All were dead or dying.
There had been ten altogether - three in the cab, seven in the back. Two were completely rigged out in FRELIMO uniform; two sported FRELIMO trousers and boots with civilian shirts and the remainder were dressed in an assortment of clothing. There was very little in the way of documents although later examination of the paperwork revealed one man was ZANLA.
The small quantity of smallarms ammunition, FRELIMO clothing cigarettes and stores all pointed to it having been a supply vehicle. At last the SAS were able to replenish their own meagre supplies.
They searched the bodies, reloaded their RPD belts from the ammunition in the Land-Rover, while a couple of men watched the road for any reaction.
The commander and his assistant meanwhile prepared to burn the vehicle. But destroying a vehicle is not the easy job it is always made out to be in the movies. And it is much harder with diesel fuel.
They had tried a variety of methods before, so knew the shortcuts. Soon the vehicle was prepared for destruction.
“EVERYONE READY?” the commander yelled at last.
“Okay ... Light up!” he ordered.
The Land-Rover was soon blazing away. The bodies had been left either in the vehicle or where they fell.
The ambush party was moving fast, leaving a trail of footprints in the dirt track. Pete Cole was tasked to booby-trap the spoor.
While the others took a breather, he took two camouflaged tins and pegged them down, one on either side of their spoor. There was a grenade in each tin and a tripwire attached to both grenades stretching across the path of their spoor.
The pins were removed from the grenades, with the levers being held down by the tins. The idea was that when someone walked into the tripwire it pulled the grenades out of the tins, releasing the levers - and bang!
It was not the most sophisticated method, but it was a simple and effective means of discouraging the enemy from following up. As Bob was to comment in his log: “It’s easy being a terrorist.”
They walked until just after dark, then they lay up until first light, keeping a guard as always. Then it was back to the canoes to join the two who had had to stay awake throughout the ambush party’s absence to keep radio contact with them and Salisbury.
They spent the rest of the day cleaning their weapons and kit, reloading magazines and resting. They put a sentry in position to watch their spoor, in case someone came along, but it remained quiet. No one came to investigate - no one suspected them of operating from the lake.
Again they set off, first paddling three or so kilometres through the treetops that afternoon, then as it got dark out on to the open lake and into a slight head wind.
They had spent almost two weeks on the lake and were to cross to the northern side to stir up things there for a change and draw attention from their spot of action on the southern shore.
After the desolation, shallow stretches and foul water of the southern side, they were delighted to find the northern bank grassy, the water clear and altogether much more pleasant.
The area had been hilly before the lake was formed and they were able to make their base 100 metres above the waterline with good natural shade and cover.
Now they planned to attack a small FRELIMO base next to Nhende aldeamento village, and, as they were due to be resupplied with ammunition, landmines and rockets the following night they could afford to expend a fair amount of ammunition on the attack.
Bob gave his orders and all twelve men set off at 17h30. They moved through the thick thorny bush towards a dirt road and Karl Lutz had the unenviable task of walking in front, getting his hands, arms and clothes torn as he led the way. Once they got on to the dirt road that ran from the lake to the barracks town, the going was easy.
Trooper Dale O’Mulligan had a landmine and Pete Cole an entrenching tool and on the commander’s order, laid the mine in a puddle in the road. They were soon on their way again and arrived at the bottom of an airstrip on the outskirts of the FRELIMO camp. It was now 21h00.
There was a line of buildings that looked very much like an army barracks running down the side of the airstrip and they could see a radio mast near the largest brick building. There were plenty of lights on and they could hear the unmistakable throb of a generator.
Bob McKenna, Pete Cole and Karl Lutz moved forward on to the airstrip for a closer inspection of the buildings, and just then, the generator stopped and most of the lights went out.
They got to within 100 metres of the barracks and studied the area with their nightscopes and binoculars. Fifteen minutes later they had made their appreciation and returned to the others.
They were to split into three groups of four and it was 22h00 when the little groups advanced towards their various firing positions eighty metres from the barracks.
Inside a radio was playing.
Fifteen minutes later, Bob initiated the attack. Sniper-trained Dale O’Mulligan was, as always, quicker off the mark than everyone else and his rocket smashed into the building Then everyone joined in, putting down a fierce weight of fire.
Rockets slammed into the buildings, smallarms fire was aimed into the windows and vehicles, and rifle grenades were fired over the buildings into the courtyards and parade square beyond.
But there was no return fire. The radio had stopped playing, But no one ventured out from the nearby Aldeamento village. Not even a dog barked.
When all the rifle grenades had been expended, the three group commanders heaved white phosphorus grenades at the main barracks. Then, having caused enough commotion for one night, they withdrew behind the smokescreen.
They had to be on their way before FRELIMO rounded up their men and gave chase, and they still had an eight kilometre (5 mile) walk to where they had hidden their canoes.
Their journey was to take them along the shoreline and it meant clambering over rocks and fallen trees, which proved extremely hard going.
As they struggled over the boulders, shots rang out from the direction of the barracks ... the only apparent reaction from the enemy. It was pitch black and the terrain was becoming more and more appalling. In the end Bob. not wanting to risk a broken leg or ankle, was forced to call a halt.
They waited until it got light enough to continue their struggle, and at 04h40 they reached their canoes to find they had only been a couple of kilometres away from them after all.
It had been one of the worst walks they had experienced and they would not be trying the shoreline trick again.
Daybreak found them basing up on yet another little island. It rained practically all day, but nothing could dampen their spirits once they heard the landmine that they had buried in the puddle go off. As they watched the smoke and dust billow into the air, they wondered what and who had hit it.
The weather had cleared long before the resupply arrived that night, They never got to meet the pilots who flew these particular sorties, but they were grateful for their skills.
The Dak dropped four boxes that night and one landed just ten paces from Bob’s bivvy. The food, ammunition, mines, rockets, canoe spares and batteries would keep them in business for a while longer.
They awoke to a sunny morning and spent the day drying kit sorting out the resupply, distributing rations, equipment and ammunition, and patching canoes. As usual, they were out on the lake again that night... and the following night they experienced one of the worst storms of the trip.
They tried rafting-up in a small group of trees but the waves were far too big and began throwing them dangerously close to the trees. The storm showed no sign of abating.
“Let’s make a dash along the shoreline.” Bob yelled above the roar of the elements, as he tried to make himself heard.
It was still very hard going and they were taking in water from some of the larger waves. They had travelled about one kilometre when they found a sheltered spot to beach and to wait out the storm.
The guard was briefed to watch for a change in the weather as they intended moving on again when the weather calmed. But 03h00 came and went and still the lake was far too rough to venture on. Would it never calm, they wondered? But the lake gave back no answer. The weather was certainly controlling this op.
Next day, Pete Cole was briefed he was to lead a six-man mining party to the ZANLA infiltration route at Chinhanda Crossroads south of the lake. They spent most of the day preparing their equipment and landmines… and late that afternoon, changed into their walking boots, blackened-up, and were ferried back to the southern shore.
They walked for six hours and at times had to struggle through extremely thick thorn bush. This time Corporal Dave Berry was leading the way and did a great job.
His hands were torn and bleeding. He had cuts and scratches everywhere and his clothing was ripped.
They allowed themselves the luxury of a break then they were soon on their way again... and nine hours after beginning their journey, they eased their packs from their aching backs and settled down in the bush. It began to rain almost immediately and as water was now short, they stretched bivvies between the trees to catch some rainwater and soon had enough to brew some tea.
They stayed there for the 12 hours of daylight then continued after darL moving through the thick bush using elephant trails which ran roughly in the direction they wanted to go. Three-and-a-half hours later they reached a road near Chinhanda Crossroads ... the ZANLA infiltration route.
It was a dirt road with plenty of vehicle spoor. The fresh boot patterns told that a FRELIMO patrol had recently walked towards the crossroads, then returned. But the coast was clear, and they set to work immediately.
The six men had their mine-laying drill off pat. They selected a place to lay the mine... put a bivvy on the road to avoid leaving spoor. With early-warning sentries posted on both sides of the roads, the others prepared the mine... began digging... collected topsoil putting the remainder into a bag... the anti-lift device went into the hole followed by the landmine. All except one man moved away... he armed the mine, filled in the hole with soil packing it down well, hiding surplus soil well clear of the road.
Then they camouflaged the spot to look like the surrounding area by taking a mugful of water from a waterbottle and flicking the water hard on the topsoil to give the impression that large raindrops had fallen recently, which had in fact happened. Thus the area easily blended in with its surroundings.
The road was wet and sandy and it took only thirty minutes to complete the job. The commander was satisfied the mine was well-camouflaged, confident that patrols would not find their mine: equally confident that a ZANLA or FRELIMO vehicle would, as those were the only vehicles in the area.
They checked the area, called in the early-warnings: then it was back to the road crossed earlier to plant another mine.
Then they returned to the lake, bypassing a native kraal where the dogs barked as always. But the SAS saw no one and were soon on their way back to the island base and relaxing with tea and a well-deserved rest after debriefing...
![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)
It was now three weeks since they left Rhodesia. They were almost at the eastern end of the lake and Bob told his team they would be starting west.
The next task was to be a vehicle ambush some 15 kilometres (nine miles) east of Daque, another FRELIMO garrison town on the southern shore. Leaving two sentries behind to guard the canoes, the others started another long difficult approach march.
Even at night the weather was as hot as hell and they had to add salt to their water to prevent heat fatigue. The availability of water, would in fact determine how long the ambush position could be manned.
The group reached the target area, found a suitable ambush site and moved back from the road slightly to hide up in the bush.
A small group went forward and laid a landmine to assist the ambush and that job was completed just before sunrise.
Cautiously, Pete Cole and a sentry checked out the camouflaging of the landmine. A little pat here... pick up a bit of dark soil from the lighter there... flick up a bit of grass that had been trodden on... it all looked perfectly natural, so good in fact that he had to place a stick on the opposite side of the road to indicate exactly where the mine was.
The mine-layers moved back to join the others and settled down to wail It was not a pleasant wait. It was extremely hot, there was little water and swarms of mopani flies gathered, tiny black flies the size of a matchhead; they drove men crazy in the bush in their search for moisture.
And this day, the mopanis came in droves ... settling and walking in the men’s hair, ears, eyes and mouths and up their noses. And the more that were killed, the more arrived, attracted no doubt by the strange smell the flies gave off when swatted.
The flies were indeed a scourge of the bush and many men wore headnets for protection. But these could only be worn while waiting for a target, as they tended to restrict vision. Soldiers certainly couldn’t risk wearing them while walking through the bush.
![125 - cabbora bassa](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/125%20-%20cabbora%20basa.png)
The only traffic on the road all day was an African on a bicycle. That night, the commander sent out a water party, who found a puddle but they were only able to scoop out enough to fill two two-quart (4.5 litre) waterbags. This precious water was shared out the following morning.
Next day was hot and humid and the ambushers waited in vain under an overcast sky for a vehicle to drive into the trap.
Then the water ran out altogether. Bob decided they would stay put until the end of the day; if nothing appeared by then, the ambush would be called off.
Forty minutes before deadline, they heard the unmistakable sound of a vehicle. As they sprang into action and took up firing positions, a tractor with a trailer came into sight, bearing 12 FRELIMO straight for the killing ground.
Somehow, both trailer and tractor missed the SAS landmine. But there was to be no escape for the enemy. Ten Rhodesian weapons were already trained on them and within seconds, rounds from Bob and Pete’s rifles had killed the driver, then the others opened up from a range of twenty metres. Their victims didn’t stand a chance.
The tractor continued up the road with the dead driver slumped over the wheel... and even before most of the FRELIMO troops had a chance to realise what was happening or had time to react, they were blasted off the trailer. A couple of highly motivated men managed to scramble off the trailer but they, too. met the same fate.
By the time the shooting stopped, 11 FRELIMO lay dead, and one wounded man had escaped. How he got away was to remain a mystery as he had definitely taken at least two hits and had left a trail of blood behind him.
Radio intercepts later indicated he had finally staggered into Daque to spread much alarm and despondency.
The ambush was all over in seconds... and the tractor was still ticking over and completely undamaged.
The trailer was full of clothing and equipment plus large quantities of food and ammunition ... mortar bombs, stick grenades, boxes of smallarms ammunition, a Russian mine detector and 11 AKs. Equipment and ammunition they didn’t need themselves were destroyed with explosives taken along specifically for the purpose... and the RPD gunners and personnel with AKs refilled belts and magazines.
They were reluctant to destroy a very good, almost new tractor, but, as they could not take it with them, it had to go the hard way. A small charge on the engine and a match soon took care of it.
One body was booby-trapped by taking the pin out of a grenade and laying the body to hold the lever down. When the body was moved, the lever would be released and the grenade would detonate. Again not very fancy, but it invariably worked.
Some of them set about destroying the enemy rifles - bending the barrels of the AKs between forks of trees and scattering the parts on the burning tractor and into the bush.
Others searched the bodies and many documents were found. It was only when they were examined further that it was learned the one of their victims had been the new CO of the FRELIMO base at Mkumbura.
He had been carrying the new radio codes, frequencies and callsigns for the whole of Tete Province for the following months - information that was certain to be of use to the Rhodesian side, The Rhodesians also now held all the mail destined for the Mkumbura Garrison.
Then it was back to the lake. On the way they found water in a riverbed and made a well-deserved brew. Morale was now extremely high.
The next day, the dull thud of an explosion in the distance indicated the success of the landmine but it was several weeks before the canoeists heard the details. According to radio intercepts, the wounded survivor had staggered in to the nearby FRELIMO base to tell of the ambush and a patrol was sent to investigate. When they saw the effects of the ambush, reinforcements were called to help recover the bodies and vehicles.
A whole company of FRELIMO arrived to sweep through the ambush area in search of the attackers. Then they sent for another tractor and trailer to collect the bodies.
In the meantime, the booby-trapped body was picked up - and three FRELIMO were wounded as the hidden grenade exploded.
When the new tractor and trailer arrived, the driver travelled down the side of the road to avoid all the bodies spread out in front of him. He reversed and loaded up all the dead and wounded, then set off back to base. As there were no longer any obstacles littered around, he drove straight down the centre of the road.
The tractor passed over the SAS landmine uneventfully. Not so the trailer. The ensuing blast tore into the trailer, causing even more casualties and flinging the pile of dead bodies and booby-trap casualties in all directions.
At that, FRELIMO lost all interest in the affair. The wounded were helped back to base but the bodies were abandoned.
The flotilla meanwhile was continuing on its way ...

Within days, the SAS arrived back on an island where some boxes of captured FRELIMO rations had been cached, not substantial enough to live on but making a pleasant change, containing tins of fish from Norway, chocolate milk and cheese from Holland, corned beef from Tanzania and fruit juice from Portugal.
Despite the slight variation to their diet, some men were starting to feel run down and a weight loss was becoming very apparent. Two corporals had become noticeably thin and Dave Arkwright was looking particularly skeletal.
They were very low on supplies and some men had already eaten their last food; everyone had used his last tea bag. There were only six dehydrated meals left among the whole group.
There was no sugar left at all and when the resupply failed to arrive the second night, Pete Cole wrote in his log: “The operation has now turned into a survival exercise. We spent all morning catching fish in the net and grenading the shallow shoreline, finally ending up with 14 large fish. We boiled them in an old ammo box, which satisfied everyone.
“The lack of sugar is a problem, so we chopped out a mopani nest for honey, but there was not enough to make much difference. It took Dave Berry and I three hours to chop it out of a tree and it was hardly worth the effort
“We have located two beehives in trees and will try and smoke one to get some honey during the night if the resupply doesn’t arrive.
“… Despite the lack of food, morale is still high and it certainly took a boost when the resupply finally arrived at 19hl5. The drop was accurate and by 19h30 we were eating the customary chickens.”
Weapons had already been cleaned and oiled, and knives rubbed with vaseline to keep them rustfree, and when the canoe repairs were carried out the fleet was fully operational again.

They were now on their way back home, it was almost beyond belief that in almost six weeks, they had not paddled for a single night where the wind had been favourable. For the three weeks they went eastwards the wind blew from the east... and now they were going westwards it was blowing from the west.
Eventually after six long and eventful weeks the operation drew to a close. That last night on the lake they had coffee laced with rum to celebrate the successful conclusion of the mission.
Fortunately, they did not have to take their leave of the lake via the Musengezi River. The choppers would be coming to take them home the following morning.
In a way, they would be sorry to leave the lake but after the total isolation of their surroundings they were certainly looking forward to getting back to civilisation with the chance to talk to someone else other than the same group of men they had lived and eaten with for six weeks.
That they all got on with each other for six long weeks of living in such close proximity to each other was a measure of their special selection and training. Only mature, self-reliant troops were capable of such missions.
The following morning they cleared a landing zone for the choppers by blowing down two large trees, then cleared the rest of the trees with matchets and entrenching tools. Soon, five Alouette choppers arrived to recover them and their equipment. They must certainly have looked a dirty dozen. They sported beards, their hair curled on to their shoulders and their clothes were tattered and torn.
They flung their kit into the choppers and clambered in after it. The sun was shimmering on the vast smelly, beautiful lake as the choppers climbed out of the LZ taking the troublesome intruders back home.
And so ended the first extremely successful lake op on Cabora Bassa. They had paddled 540 kilometres (335 miles). 140 kilometres (87 miles) more than they had planned...... had left a toll of dead and wounded including the CO. 21C and Political Commissar of the Mkumbura FRELIMO garrison and had disrupted the traffic on the only access road from Tete to Mkumbura. So effective was their mining and ambushing that attempts were made to build a parallel road on some stretches.
They had amply proved that operating from the lake was a viable proposition... and it would not be many weeks before _Cockleshell Heros_ Part II got under way.
Colour Sergeant Karl Lutz and his crew mate, Corporal Dave Berry, were to become old hands at the paddling game. They were to take part in phase two and three and were to spend 13 out of the first 17 weeks of the year canoeing around Cabora Bassa.
On the third trip, the SAS reduced every boat at the lake’s largest harbour to matchsticks. As the black of the night turned to a vivid red and boats burned and crackled and drums of petrol helped fuel the flames of destruction, two of the saboteurs, Karl Lutz and Mick Graham were caught in the glare as if on a stage.
They paddled a bit faster and reached the safety of darkness uneventfully. The blaze was a spectacular sight and the mission was the most successful operation on the lake.
The first lake op was undoubtedly the hardest, however. In subsequent ones. the operators were choppered to the lake shore, avoiding the long hazardous trip down the Musengezi River.
The many valuable lessons learned from the mistakes and experiences of those first _Cockleshell Heroes_ were to make subsequent lake ops by the SAS and Selous Scouts far easier, for the commander returned with a lengthy list of recommendations to improve conditions next time around.
All the lake ops had achieved their aim of disrupting movement on the infiltration routes from Tete to north-eastern Rhodesia. And, as anticipated, ZANLA and their FRELIMO friends didn’t have a clue where the SAS had come from.
