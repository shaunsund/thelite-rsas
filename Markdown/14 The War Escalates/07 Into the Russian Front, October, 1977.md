For more than six months, the SAS had been in control of the Tete Province of Mozambique.  
It was the Rhodesian Special Air Service, _not_ FRELIMO, who controlled the area. Nothing moved; nothing dare move for fear of an attack from the SAS, who had been popping in here, there and everywhere, mining, ambushing, stirring things up, waylaying ZANLA and their FRELIMO comrades, and leaving a trail of bodies, broken vehicles and demolished buildings.  
Then, in May, just to show who was in charge, they took over an entire town. Not only did the SAS succeed in taking over the whole province, they cut Tete off from Rhodesia and pushed ZANLA and FRELIMO further away from the border to Tete town itself. As a result the number of ZANLA operating in the whole of the Operation _Hurricane_ area had dropped from 800 to 210.  
Then the SAS were told they were being withdrawn from Tete to go into the southeast, the Gaza Province. They had operated there before, but now they were to go in-depth to try and repeat their Tete success, to halt the ZANLA infiltration into the south-east of Rhodesia.  
Had they been allowed to remain in Tete, there is no doubt they would have got closer to the town.  
As it was, the security force unit which replaced them did not have the expertise or the staying power to maintain the SAS’s good work. It may well have been boring for them, as there was nothing much going on because of previous SAS activity.  
In the event, the province eventually reverted to what it had been before the SAS started their campaign of intensive harassment. The replacement unit took a hammering and FRELIMO got bolder. The Tanzanians began clearing the roads of landmines for them and as a result, terrorist incursions into Rhodesia stepped up.  
There were simply never enough SAS men to be everywhere they were needed. Unlike other units, which boasted 600 and 1 000 men. the SAS only ever had 200 operators at any time, and then only on specific large scale operations when the commanders had to call up TA and extra regimentally employed members.  
The SAS was to take over from the Seious Scouts, who had been having a terrible time in the south-east and were telling the SAS all sorts of horror stories. There were some Scouts who said the SAS would be run out of the area by FRELIMO. The SAS said that remained to be seen.  
The Scouts had previously attacked the terrorist camp at Mapai, blowing buildings and taking over the airfield. As a result, ZANLA and FRELIMO could be expected to be more alert in their endeavours to locate Rhodesians entering their territory.  
Apart from the Mapai attack, the Scouts had generally concentrated their attacks on the rail line, and had done a good job, too.  
But the SAS now planned a new tactic, one that the enemy would not be expecting ... they were to operate south of Mapai and harass the parallel road system and convoy route front Barragem to Mapai.  
Not only had the SAS to get into the south-east undetected, but they had to remain so. at least until their first task was completed.  
Then commander, Major Brian Robinson hit on an idea. Surely they could carry out a HALO entry (high altitude low opening)? After all, the higher they were the less suspicion they would arouse from people on the look-out below.  
It was the only logical answer. But unlike previous missions, Brian wanted 24 men to freefall in, not just a couple of four-man pathfinder teams in separate areas.  
If successful, it would be the largest number of freefailers to jump on a single operation during the Rhodesian war. It was a daring idea. But it was not without its problems.  
The mission called for two dozen men to leap out of a plane at dead of night _without_ a moon, in the heart of very hostile territory and with almost double the amount of kit they would normally carry.  
As they would need enough equipment to carry out their first ambush, they would be jumping with rifles, 60 millimetre mortars and RPD machineguns, and each RPD gunner would have 500 rounds of ammunition on him.  
They would have to land on a single DZ and regroup before first light. To do that, they would have to exit the plane virtually touching each other, then keep as tight a formation in the air as possible, but without getting entangled with each other.  
They were to infiltrate from 12 000 feet above ground level, which was _just_ on the oxygen level, To add to the risks, there would be only _one_ emergency oxygen bottle in the plane to revive anyone who passed out.  
In addition, they were to take along three boxes of additional kit to resupply themselves after their first ambushing task - and that, too, had to end up in the same place.  
The boxes with their parachutes were to be pushed to earth first and would carry a flashing strobe light to enable the freefallers following to know where they landed. Fixed to each box would be an automatic opening device designed to release the parachute at a pre~determined height.  
The strobes would flash all the way to the ground and continue flashing once the boxes had touched down, thus enabling the parachutists to zero in on them, and providing them with a single rallying point.  
The freefallers, led by the mission commander, would have red or green lights on their helmets. As they jumped out of the plane, they would either turn right or left depending on their number and colour.  
Thus, if everyone managed to stay close together on exit, there would be one stream of red lights descending through the darkness and another of green - and hopefully, they would not get entangled with each other.  
Although they were to use civilian pilot Jack Malloch’s DC-7 for the actual drop, their practise jumps with kit were from a Dakota. And although they were able to work out their exits from the plane, correct their body angles and try out their red and green light system to avoid mid-air collisions, they would find the Dakota just did not give the same effect as the DC-7.  
The rehearsals, too, were carried out with packs of only average weight. Come the day of reckoning - October 11 - they were to find they bore no resemblance to the proper thing.  
As their packs were strapped underneath their buttocks to rest against the backs of their upper thighs, and as the amount of kit each man carried began to mount up, the parachute training staff responsible for checking their equipment at New Sarum began to get worried.  
Yet despite their exceptionally heavy loads, there was some debate among the more experienced freefallers about the necessity of having to wear the automatic opening device. Some felt they did not need them. But Brian Robinson and the parachute training staff wanted no unnecessary heroics, and insisted.  
Their checks over, the 24-man freefall team lumbered into the DC-7, taking up their places on the makeshift benches. Then it was off across the border into the Gaza Province.  
As the DC-7 sped through the night, the atmosphere in the plane was tense.  
Would their additional weight affect their exit speeds? Would they be able to keep a tight formation? Would the lack of moon make if difficult for them to assess the wind drift, of prime consideration to the freefall paratrooper? And would they pass out?  
The pilot and navigator had their own problems too. Not for Rhodesian pilots the fancy navigational aids of more sophisticated air forces. The aircraft had no navigational equipment other than a compass and the drop was to take place in enemy territory without a moon.  
Pilot Jack Malloch and his navigator were to drop the troops on a time and distance basis in the dead of night. They had worked out their timings and distances precisely ... but without a moon and sophisticated equipment, would it work?  
Then as they approached the border, a brilliant white glare lit up the night as an SAS operator based at Mabalouta forward headquarters, threw a flare to help the pilot pinpoint his position.  
Towards 03h00 and 12 000 feet above ground level, a trooper collapsed through lack of oxygen. A dispatcher hurried across, revived him with the emergency oxygen set, then helped the visibly pale man back on to the bench.  
But the operation they were about to undertake was a complicated one and time was short. The red light was already on. They would have to get going.  
The woozy operator would have to be left behind. Quickly. they took the man’s mortar equipment from him, the commander, Dave Dodson delegating someone else to carry it.  
The rest had already lumbered to their feet and staggered to the open door. The three boxes containing their additional kit were lined up on rollers on the opposite side of the open door, now seconds from falling through the darkness into Gaza.  
Then off the boxes went, crashing over the rollers, their flashing lights already working.  
Immediately, Dave Dodson launched himself out into the night, following the flashing lights of the boxes down through the darkness. The second man stepped into the air after him.  
One by one, the heavily-laden freefallers shuffled towards the door. But the angle of the rollers became a major hurdle as they squeezed through the doorway and attempted to get into a good exit position.  
Normally, kitted-up freefallers would swivel around on a ninety degree angle from the door to face the engine, presenting themselves square on to the slipstream and getting into a good face-to-earth freefall position.  
But because they were being particularly careful not to step on the rollers, they were unable to get into a good exit position… and, as the DC-7 was much bigger and faster than the Dakota, having two engines instead of just one outside the door, the slipstream they encountered was far greater than they had been expecting.  
And those freefailers who presented only half their bodies to the slipstream ended up tumbling and spinning head-over-heels through the air.  
Then one man, weighed down with kit, tripped one metre from the door, slowing down the flow of exiting troops. The dispatchers picked him up bodily and threw him out of the plane.  
Far below, Captain Dave Dodson was on his way down through the night. He pulled his ripcord at 2 500 feet. The other chutes were to crack open higher up, a precaution to avoid mid-air entanglements, thus creating a staggered effect.  
The heavily-laden troops were finding their ability to manoeuvre around the sky impaired by all their kit, and instead of the nice red and green line of lights, it was beginning to look like a checkerboard as they skated across the night sky.  
The last man out of the plane, Jan Greyling. staggered to the door under the weight of all his kit. Then just as he leapt into space, he blacked out ...  
By now the three boxes had landed and the commander followed the flashing strobe lights down. He landed nearby, climbed out of his harness and waited for the rest of his party to join him.  
They were scattered all over the bush and when he totted up, he found that four of his men were missing. Most of them wandered in at first light, and Iain Bowen, who had landed on the side of an anthill was carried in piggy-back style.  
Of the 23 men who had jumped in to Gaza that night, Iain Bowen had a broken leg, two had twisted ankles and one had a stick in his buttocks, all the result of wearing heavy equipment and being unable to see exactly where they were landing. And one was missing.  
It was quite an entrance into the south-east.  
But the pilot - without a moon or sophisticated navigational equipment to help him - had dropped the troops on time and within five kilometres (three miles) of their planned DZ. It was an amazing achievement.  
Missing was Sergeant Jan Greyling, who had lost consciousness as he leapt from the plane. Jan had come to floating down under his canopy. An experienced freefaller, he had been one of the men against using an automatic opening device.  
Now he owed his life to Brian Robinson for insisting he wear one.  
Yet despite his relief at having an automatic device firmly in place and working, Jan was a worried man. He couldn’t see any of the red and green lights twinkling in the darkness beneath him, and even before he landed, he knew he was completely alone.  
It was the first time he had been in the area and he did not know his exact location. And tonight of all nights, he did not have a radio with him.  
But now, despite his initial misgivings, his SAS training and survival instincts were beginning to take ever. He knew he could not sit where he was and wait until someone came and found him, He would have to go and find them.  
Drawing a map in the sand with a stick, he worked out that from the aircraft speed and the average gap between each man out of the door, that he must be seven kilometres (four miles) from the rest of the crew.  
To the west was the Limpopo River and beyond that South Africa and the Kruger National Park. He decided that if he couldn’t find his companions, he would strike out for the South African border.  
He reviewed in his mind what he would need with him - what was essential, what could be safely left behind. He buried his main and reserve chute and all the unnecessary kit; and at first light set off with his water and troop medical kit, which he might well need should he ever meet up with the others.  
Then he heard the familiar sound of parachutes being torn down from trees.  
Cautiously optimistic, yet sure it was friends, Jan eased through the bush and closed nearer to the sound - only to find himself in the midst of a herd of elephant ripping the branches off trees. He nimbly skirted away and took off through the bush.  
Hour after hour he trudged through the scrub searching for the 22 other freefallers, getting more concerned all the time, cautious about what lay ahead and who might be following behind.  
Once he heard a shot ring out. But was it FRELIMO? Could it be friends? Jan kept setting himself objectives. Alter midday, he would go west, then the next stop would be the Limpopo.  
That afternoon, he began to pick up spoor of boots and equipment. It looked like a typical sweepline searching for someone. Obviously FRELIMO, he told himself. Now he was even more cautious than before.  
Then came the distant sound of someone chopping at a tree. Was it the freefallers trying to communicate, indicating their emergency RV? Perhaps it was FRELIMO signalling their men to regroup? On the other hand, it might just be a local chopping firewood.  
Perhaps the spoor he was still following belonged to his SAS friends after all? He fired a shot and almost immediately the sound of a double tap, two shots in close succession, came back That, Jan told himself, was definitely a signal and he cheered up.  
The mission commander, who had dispatched search parties at first light, now sent out another patrol to locate Jan. And 15 hours after jumping into oblivion, a much relieved Jan was delighted to see the familiar faces of SAS men approaching through the bush.  
The final tally was four men injured and 19 men fit and ready for action.  
Jan Greyling patched up the casualties, and although Iain Bowen with his broken leg qualified for immediate casevac, they were all to remain in the bush until the first ambush had been sprung. To send for a casevac chopper beforehand would have alerted FRELIMO and ZANLA to their presence in the area, and they would have lost the element of surprise.  
￼![161 - into russian front](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/161%20-%20into%20russian%20front.png)  
Leaving the casualties behind, the other 19 men began their eight kilometre (five mile) walk to the main road/rail line. At the edge of the bush near the main road, they came upon a sandalwood forest and then the road/rail line. They were now at the Mpuzi siding three kilometres from Mapai. Captain Dave Dodson realised they would have to ambush road traffic with the rail line between them and their target.  
To get any nearer to the road would mean leaving telltale spoor in the sandy soil. They would simply have to mount the ambush from the edge of the sandalwood forest, and because of the distance involved, they would not be able to use claymore mines.  
They settled down to await a target.  
A ZANLA convoy of three trucks was already on its way and as the first truck came in sight, the SAS were faced with the most incredible sight. It was filled to capacity with arms and ammunition boxes. And ZANLA were perched all over the truck wherever they could find a place to sit.  
Then suddenly, the ambush was initiated and rounds smashed into the driver’s cab.  
The truck came to a grinding halt and the opening shots were followed by an intensive heavy weight of fire, the attackers witnessing the effects of what the manuals called “maximum automatic fire” - ambushing for its sheer destructive and devastating capability.  
One second ZANLA could be seen sitting in various positions of relaxation; a split second afterwards they were still sitting in the same positions as if they had never been disturbed. Except now, they were lifeless.  
One man jumped off the truck and ran down the road. The commander leapt to his feet and directed his men to get the fleeing ZANLA.  
As the man spun around, he sprayed automatic fire at them. A round smashed into Trooper Dave Collins’ head, one man got a bullet in his foot and another a nick in the head. All three injured men had been lying down. Miraculously, the commander, who had been standing in the midst of them, escaped injury. The enemy responsible was pumped with lead and killed.  
Only a couple of ZANLA were able to escape with their lives… and by the time the commander yelled the ceasefire there were twenty ZANLA lying dead in the sun. Their final journey was over and the truck was burning and exploding.  
Immediately the ambush started, the drivers of the other two trucks in the convoy did an about-turn and roared back down the road. But a Hunter strike was put in and they too were destroyed.  
Back down the road, it looked as if the injured trooper, Dave Collins, was dead. Jan Greyling patched him up and they moved back into the safety of the bush and called for an immediate casevac. Amazingly, despite his terrible injuries. Dave was to survive.  
The five freefall casualties who had been patiently sitting it out in the bush for five days waiting for the ambush to be sprung were also choppered out.  
Eighteen static line paratroopers later joined the freefallers and they then split into three main groups to continue their ambushing programme.  
It was to be the last time the SAS would freefall into the area in large numbers. Thereafter any plane which went over was immediately suspect.  
As expected, ZANLA had been caught unawares by the attack on their convoy and they and their FRELIMO friends would now be more alert to the possibility of road ambushes.  
![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
As far as the SAS could determine, the south-east was nearly as hard as the Selous Scouts had warned them. and it was going to get harder. From now until the last days of the war, the SAS would be operating in the south-east, and they were big enough to admit it was a particularly difficult area to master.  
There were no high points in the region. They would find that water was desperately short at some times of the year, and the few pans of water there, were very difficult to find. The SAS would listen for frogs at night for an indication of where to find the odd oasis. And when they did locate water, they would often discover it was undrinkable.  
The soft, sandy soil made anti-tracking exceptionally difficult. And the security forces were almost always reported to FRELIMO by the local civilians, who were extremely hostile and would even help FRELIMO track down the SAS.  
The Rhodesians would never have enough heavy equipment with them and what little they did have was up against FRELIMO tanks and armoured personnel carriers.  
The south-east was also a long way from any air support. A chopper flight from Mabalouta to Mpuzi for instance, was two hours, and as a result, close air support was seldom used by the SAS.  
FRELIMO in the south-east were far more aggressive and numerous than those the SAS had encountered in Tete and would actively go in search of a fight. The main route where the security forces located ZANLA and FRELIMO was on the parallel road and rail line, and there were constant patrols along the route.  
The longer the SAS operated in the area. the more FRELIMO and their advisers developed better methods of locating them. Eventually, FRELIMO groups were based at all the various sidings down the rail line. Then, whenever an aircraft was heard in the area, the various groups would begin patrolling, covering their portion of ground and looking for spoor, which because of the sandy soil was easy to find.  
If the SAS were looking for action, they knew they would find it in the southeast.  
“A” Troop {later Squadron) was to have a particularly active time in the south-east and much SAS blood was spilled there. There is no doubt that had the Selous Scouts returned to the region when “A” Troop were there, they would have found it considerably harder than before.  
Operating in the region would ultimately become more a battle of wits between the SAS. FRELIMO and their Russian and East German advisers. So bad did it become, the SAS dubbed the region “The Russian Front”.
