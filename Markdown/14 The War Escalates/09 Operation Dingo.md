_“We are fighting for the existence of law and order here
and you cannot just sit back and let bases like that exist.  
Yes, we will continue to operate behind enemy lines.”_  
— LIEUTENANT-GENERAL PETER WALLS

Nineteen seventy-seven was drawing to a close and it was almost twelve months since SAS commander Brian Robinson had called in his intelligence officer, Scotty McCormack and given him a special task.  
The SAS commander had been tipped off about the presence of a huge ZANLA complex ninety kilometres {56 miles) inside Mozambique, and Scotty was given the job of finding out every scrap of information he could about the place.  
Unlike the Selous Scouts, the SAS did not have their own SB officers to provide them with up-to-the-minute intelligence, and, as the information about the ZANLA camp was not coming in to them, they would just have to go and find it for themselves.  
Scotty began his investigations immediately and learned that an increasing number of ZANLA being caught in the _Thrasher_ operational area had been telling SB that they had been at the camp which was roughly opposite Umtali. Some called it New Farm; others Vanduzi or Chimoio. as it was only 17 kilometres ( 10 miles) north of Chimoio town.  
All this information had been forwarded to the Central Intelligence Organisation in Salisbury. And there it sat. Nothing was going to be done about the camp.  
Scotty was able to glean more information about the Chimoio camp from Pete Stanton, of SB, and from the Selous Scouts intelligence officer, Alan Lindner. His dossier was getting fatter, but he wanted more.  
“Okay then,” Scotty said at last to the people in the aerial photographic department, “let’s fly it.”
When the film from the photographic run was processed, it was obvious he had not been wasting the pilot’s time.  
The camp was enormous, with 13 separate areas, and was far bigger than anything he had imagined. The photographic interpreters carried out a head count and totted up 700 ZANLA on the rifle range alone.  
Scotty got the photograph enlarged as big as it would go, then sent for Captain Jacques Dubois, of the Intelligence Corps in civilian life, Jacques worked in the Surveyor General’s office - the government mapping department - and Scotty asked him if it was possible to make a model of the camp.  
Jacques assured him it would be no problem, then, armed with the photograph and maps giving all the contours, he set to work
Top secrecy was clamped on the project and as Jacques couldn’t be seen working on the model at the Intelligence Corps headquarters, he had to build it in the SAS presentation room. He was helped by a sergeant from the Intelligence Corps and a woman from the photographic interpretation department, whose husband was a professional model maker.  
Jacques and his team worked diligently for six solid weeks getting the detail absolutely correct and the model perfectly to scale.  
Initially, to give them the detail they were after, coloured foil was placed over separate negatives of the aerial photograph. These were then placed on two overhead projectors, thrown on to a screen and viewed through coloured glasses. Thus a 3-D effect was obtained and all the camp’s features and characteristics were highlighted.  
The aerial photograph was then fitted over the papier-mâché model and according to those who saw it, “surpassed all expectations in its splendour”.  
Then. just as the finishing touches had been put on the model came a stroke of luck Umtali SB came up with a capture who had left ZANLA’s Chimoio camp two weeks earlier.  
He was sent immediately to Salisbury where Scotty sat him down before Jacques Dubois’ model.  
“Right,” said Scotty, “there’s the camp. Remember, you are looking at it from above. Now – tell me what you know.”
And the man went through the whole layout from beginning to end, placing the jigsaw together until a picture emerged that was both revealing and worrying.  
The camp was the biggest the most important ZANLA base in Mozambique... the headquarters and nerve centre of Robert Mugabe’s war machine.  
FRELIMO had allocated the entire Chimoio/Vanduzu/Pungwe area to ZANLA and since fleeing Rhodesia after the abortive detente exercise. Mugabe had begun to reconstruct the war effort from Chimoio. The ZANLA leader and his two top commanders, Rex Nhongo and Josiah Tongogara, directed operations from their high command headquarters, in an old farmhouse.  
It was from Chimoio that the thousands of ZANLA brought back from Tanzania, China and Ethiopia after training, deployed straight into Rhodesia to wage their war.  
The main part of Chimoio covered five kilometres (three miles) and there were many satellite camps, specialising in a variety of tasks, as well as a centre for women combatants.  
The enemy were extremely well dug-in in trenches and bunkers. There were a multitude of anti-aircraft positions in pits. And there were look-out towers for anti-air early-warning, which were positioned throughout the camp and manned by ZANLA with whistles.  
Civilian farm buildings, houses and grass huts were scattered throughout the complex. ZANLA had learned their lesson and eventually realised that if they positioned their base camps in confined areas, they could be boxed off and everyone in them annihilated.  
They hoped, too, that by spreading themselves among the local population, the civilians would provide them with early-warning of a Rhodesian attack.  
Chimoio camp was also close to a large FRELIMO base, and ZANLA had rightly guessed that the Rhodesians would be very reluctant to kill civilians and would not want to involve FRELIMO in their fight with ZANLA.  
Then, parallel with his study of Chimoio, Scotty turned his attention to another major ZANLA camp, called Tembue, responsible for incursions into the _Hurricane_ operational area. It was north-east of Cabora Bassa, 225 kilometres (140 miles) from Rhodesia. Tembue was easily located on aerial photography and another papier-mâché model was made and the camp brought to life.  
FRELIMO had moved in close to the Tembue camp to monitor ZANLA movement, desertion and theft.  
Scotty now had the low-down on the two most important terror bases in Mozambique, responsible for all ZANLA infiltrations into Rhodesia.  
Recruiting had been high and there were thousands of enemy amassed in the two camps. But there were not enough weapons for everyone and approaches had been made to FRELIMO to supply them with weaponry and ammunition.  
With all their anti-aircraft precautions, ZANLA felt extremely secure in their two camps. Not only had they sited them near civilians and FRELIMO as double insurance, but as Chimoio was ninety kilometres from the border, they were confident that the Rhodesians wouldn’t _dare_ attack it. It was just too far.  
As for Tembue, that was twice as far from the border, the Rhodesians wouldn’t even _dream_ of striking 200 kilometres into Mozambique. It was a ridiculous notion.  
They had not, however, reckoned with the determination of the SAS commander, Brian Robinson, his second-in-command, Mick Graham, Scotty McCormack, SAS troop commanders, and Air Force Group Captain Norman Walsh. For massive preemptive strikes against the two camps were precisely what they had in mind.  
Unlike other armies where the initiative came from the top, this time it came from a small nucleus of officers who were morally supported by Special Branch.  
They realised only too well that the insurgents had to be stopped at source, it was no use waiting until they were inside the country. Despite the lethality of fireforee, that concept could not stop the momentum of insurgent infiltration. Only pre-emptive strikes against external enemy bases could do that.  
The most daring operation of the war to date, the Selous Scouts raid into Nyadzonya/Pungwe base - commanded by ex-SAS officer Rob Warraker in August, 1976 - had taken the operators forty kilometres (25 miles) from the border as the crow flies, although it had involved a long devious journey to get there.  
But Chimoio was twice as far and Tembue five times that distance from the border and planning pre-emptive strikes against them posed a number of interesting problems.  
How could they get to the camps undetected? And how could they account for the maximum number of enemy? And, even if these problems were solved, would ComOps give their blessing to such an audaciously own operation so far from home anyway?
In view of the distance involved, it was out of the question for a strike force to drive to the targets as the Scouts had done. Tembue in the north was too far to go. And it was impossible to drive to Chimoio and remain undetected, it was a heavily populated tribal area and word would have reached the camp long before they got there… and they didn’t want to run the risk of finding the camp vacated.  
That left only air effort - and that was something that had been forbidden by the hierarchy, except for casualty evacuation, and then only in the case of serious injury.  
Undaunted by the difficulties, Brian Robinson, Norman Walsh and team pressed on with their planning, knowing that if _they_ didn’t push for attacks on the camps, nothing would be done at all… the camps would remain in being… the insurgents would pour into the country in their thousands.

Years of watching camps during attacks had proved to the Rhodesians that no matter how often the enemy had been shown where the escape routes were, they never stuck to them. Experience had shown that when the Rhodesians arrived, the enemy had run in whichever direction they happened to be facing at the time.  
Thus, it was no good positioning stop groups on _likely_ escape routes, If a camp was to be hit effectively, it was obvious the whole camp had to be surrounded.  
Brian Robinson and Hight-Lieutenant Frank Hales had developed a method to do just that. Called _the box_, it involved sending Dakotas or helicopters to all four sides of a camp ... disgorging troops to act as stop groups all the way around the target ... enabling every possible escape route to be blocked.  
The element of surprise was total. They literally got the drop on the enemy - and they achieved the best possible results in terms of kills. But having decided the box was the best method of attacking Chimoio and Tembue camps. Brian Robinson and his team were then faced with the major problem of how they were going to get all the helicopters to the target.  
The ParaDaks - Dakotas bearing paratroopers - could get to the targets in one trip, so them was no need to worry about them.  
But the Alouette IIIs, the only helicopters Rhodesia possessed, had a very limited range and it was impossible to get them to even the nearest target in a single flight.  
It would call for a refuelling stop on the way in to the target - and another on the way out.  
In the case of Chimoio, the choppers could refuel at an administrative base inside Rhodesia to get to the target, but they would need somewhere close at hand where they could go to refuel and rearm to enable them to carry out strikes on the camp... and to top up for the journey home. Getting helicopters to Tembue, which was twice the distance from the border, called for an even more complicated manoeuvre.  
There was only one possible solution. They would have to take over a piece of Mozambican territory and establish a forward administrative base _inside_ enemy countryside for however long the operation lasted.  
They would only need one such base for the Chimoio raid, but because of the vast distance involved, they would have to set up _two_ when they attacked Tembue. It was a daring idea and nothing like it had ever been done before, But again, would ComOps go for it?
Brian Robinson and his team naturally wanted to get the best results from both camps, too. Ideally, they needed to hit them simultaneously, but the hard facts of life were that Rhodesia simply did not have sufficient aircraft to do that.  
It meant the Rhodesians ran the risk of arriving at the second target to find the enemy forewarned and the camp vacated. The team was then faced with another problem - which camp to hit first to get the maximum kills.  
![SAS Logo](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Images/SAS%20Logo.png)  
Eventually, they were satisfied with their plan and invited the hierarchy to visit SAS HQ to listen to a presentation of their proposed mission.  
With the magnificent models spread out before them, Scotty McCormack gave an intelligence briefing on the two biggest terror bases in Mozambique. Then Brian Robinson and Mick Graham presented the army case and Norman Walsh, the air force’s.  
They had to sell the entire concept to the ComOps team - the attack itself, the necessity for it, the advantages to be gained, what would happen if they did not attack it, and the admin base idea.  
The hierarchy listened in fascinated silence as the proposed plan unfolded and clearance was sought for the raid. And they didn’t like it one little bit.  
They didn’t believe the security forces could get the huge numbers of kills Brian Robinson and his team were saying they could with the limited amount of air weaponry available. As for the amazing suggestion that they establish admin bases _inside_ enemy territory ... well they were not sold on that at all.  
The Tembue plan calling for _two_ bases to be set up in Mozambique, was totally out of the question. The camp was simply too far away to even be considered as a target.  
What worried ComOps was that the external admin bases would have to be set up almost as far from the border as the targets themselves. In the event of the helicopters being discovered as they rearmed and refuelled, they would be sitting ducks. While the Rhodesians would protect the vulnerable aircraft, all the enemy needed to do would be to put a few mortar bombs in among the choppers and there would be chaos.  
If the planes were destroyed, it would be impossible to get the troops out of the target and they would face a very long trek home with all the attendant problems. Brian Robinson, Norman Walsh and their team were not keen on this aspect either, but considered it a calculated risk that had to be taken.  
As in all major missions, too, the aggressor nation had to apply a percentage aircraft loss. While nations like America could suffer a loss without being seriously affected. Rhodesia with her limited air force, sanctions, and shortage of foreign currency to replace the aircraft, could not.  
Rhodesia simply could not afford to lose a single aircraft. And to lose as many as ten. would be catastrophic. They would never be able to replace them and the Rhodesian Air Force would become virtually non-operational.  
As it was, considering the enormous scale of the proposed operation, the Rhodesians would be working with minimal numbers of aircraft. It was a ludicrous situation and everyone knew it.  
But what terrified the hierarchy most of all was world opinion. For if an aircraft was shot down in enemy territory, it would be _blatantly_ obvious to the world who the aggressors were - not that the world would not know anyway. World reaction would be far from favourable. Rhodesia, already under intense pressure from all sides, would be well and truly roasted.  
No doubt, too, the rest of the world would claim refugee camps were attacked, just as they had done on the Nyanzonia camp attacked by Selous Scouts a year beforehand. The ammunition belts on many of the bodies had been conveniently ignored by those who screamed “refugees”.  
When the idea was first mooted, it was the era of Kissinger and the Geneva Conference. Could Rhodesia be seen to be acting so _overtly_ when they had agreed to peace talks?
Finally, the ComOps hierarchy said that the Chimoio target was a possibility, but turned the Tembue plan down flat. Brian Robinson and his team would have to go back to the drawing board and have a rethink about that phase.  
The first presentation had been given in November, 1976. A year had passed - and still the operation had not been given the go-ahead.  
After the first presentation the whole idea had gone dead for a while, in the meantime, the camps were being photographed once a week and mushrooming at an alarming rate. Every single ZANLA captured inside Rhodesia was telling SB that he had either been at Chimoio or Tembue. Ships were docking along the east coast and trained ZANLA were being offloaded en route to the camp ... planeloads of men were arriving in Beira from Dar-es-Salaam... and trainloads of ZANLA were passing through Chimoio on their way into Rhodesia.  
Eventually, almost a year after the camps had first been picked up by aerial photography, the figures at Chimoio stood at between 9 000 and 11 000, making it the largest concentration of enemy ever to be in one camp at that stage of the war.  
By comparison, the figures at Tembue training camp in north-east Mozambique were small, But the 4 000 enemy there could do an awful lot of damage if they crossed into Rhodesia.  
It had become extremely frustrating to SB officers and security forces in the know to see the problem growing - and knowing that nothing was going to be done about it.  
Eventually, the possibility of attacking the camps was resurrected and Brian Robinson, his troop commanders and Air Force Group Captain Norman Walsh began an intensive phase of trying to convince ComOps that the time had come to attack the two camps. As before, they emphasised the same old argument… that the only way to stem the flow was to turn off the tap.  
As for the enemy, they had become even more confident that they were never going to be attacked by the Rhodesians.  
Finally, SAS intelligence officer Scotty McCormack was called upon to give another presentation to the ComOps team. It was his 12th presentation - the 12th time he had tried to sell the idea.  
By now Scotty knew the two camps like the back of his hand, and without a single note before him, he stood up and gave a detailed briefing, stressing the precise points he knew the hierarchy wanted to hear. Cataloguing the military facts of life, Scotty emphasised how the camps had grown, and how, if left unchecked, they would continue to grow.  
He explained the advantages to be gained in striking offensively; told how ZAN LA would want to push as many people into Rhodesia as possible before the seasonal heavy rains began and before the infiltration routes got too bad.  
The hierarchy needed no reminding that at that time of the year the bush became an enemy, too. For the rains provided ZANLA with plentiful water and lush vegetation cover, and seriously hampered security force operations.  
They needed no telling of the terror that could be caused by vast numbers of infiltrating ZANLA. The enemy were learning more than their Chimurenga songs of liberation at the two camps. The number of people on the rifle ranges alone proved that.  
Incursions were on the increase and attacks had been mainly directed towards black civilians in the rural area. Two hundred civilians had been murdered in the previous two months.  
Then the two chief architects of the plan, Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh, presented their case for the Army and Air Force. The hierarchy went away to consider all they had heard and weigh up all the pros, cons and ramifications of such a raid.  
They would have had to consider the same aspects as the year before - the possible aircraft loss; what the world would say about such an overt mission ... the biggest cross-border offensive of the war to date. On the other hand, the situation in the country was critical. Could they sit back and allow such bases to exist, particularly the two biggest camps in Mozambique, responsible for all ZANLA incursions and drastically affecting the conduct of the internal war?
The people at the top had never stopped believing either that the Rhodesian problem could be solved politically. But the Geneva Conference had failed to bring a ceasefire and the war was more intense now than it had been when the idea of striking the two camps was first put to the national planners.  
To the astonishment of Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh, their endless bulldozing had paid off. The green light was given and the operation was to be called Dingo, with Chimoio given the codename Zulu-1, and Tembue, Zulu-2. The time had come to stem the tide, to deliver a telling blow to the ZANLA war machine - to eliminate the enemy, gather intelligence and disrupt the enemy’s logistics.  
The detailed and very complex planning for the two-pronged thrust into Mozambique began immediately. Busiest of all at that stage were the people in aerial photographic who sat for days scanning photographs of Mozambique to find suitable sites for the three external admin areas.  
The admin areas - one for the Chimoio raid, two for the Tembue phase - had to be 10-15 minutes flying time from the target; in the most isolated areas possible; somewhere that could take all the helicopters; and in places where those security forces defending the aircraft during the camp attacks could parachute into.  
There had to be high ground nearby where they could position sentries… and well away from access tracks. Nor had the admin areas to be anywhere near a position the enemy could take advantage of to mortar the planes.  
It was a tall order, but eventually three suitable sites were found.  
The admin base for the Chimoio raid was to be eighty kilometres (fifty miles) inside hostile territory and only ten kilometres (six miles) from the target. The admin bases for Tembue, 225 kilometres (140 miles) from the border, were to be set up on a huge flat-topped mountain south of Cabora Bassa, nicknamed _The Train_; with the second base sited ten kilometres from the target.  
Both Chimoio and Tembue were formidable targets, and with a minimum of 9 000 ZANLA at Chimoio and 4000 at Tembue, the 185 Rhodesian ground troops who were to attack the two camps would be sorely outnumbered.  
Of the 9 000 to 11 000 at Chimoio, 4 000 were known to be fully trained, operational and armed. It is standard military doctrine that during the attack phase, the attacking force must have a three to one superiority. Rhodesians, short on manpower as they were, were not going to pay any attention to that.  
Only surprise, the well-used principle of war, could help. Repeated visits by _The Blues_ would help to even up the odds, however. Nevertheless, the planners were working on a thirty percent casualty rate.  
Using every aircraft Rhodesia possessed, they could get no more than 200 troops to the targets at any one time.  
And as the whole aim was to achieve maximum surprise, it could not be done in more than one wave. It was futile to take in one wave of troops, then go and collect another wave. For by the time the second wave got there, the enemy who had survived the initial attack would have already fled.  
Both raids were to be basically similar and were to prove classic examples of vertical envelopments.  
Chimoio - the bigger of the two camps - was to be attacked first and the 97 SAS and 48 RLI parachutists were to land on two sides of Chimoio… while forty helicopter-borne RLI troops were put down on the third. It was envisaged that the fourth side would be theoretically boxed in by the fire from the K-cars.  
Timings would be critical, with the paratroopers arriving in Chimoio exactly two minutes behind the initial air strike.  
The idea was that the anti-aircraft defences would be too busy shooting at the strike aircraft to pay any attention to the Dakotas bearing the SAS and RLI paras. The helicopter-borne troops would be put down near the camp shortly afterwards… and exactly eight minutes later the K-cars would swoop in to close off the cordon.  
The ground troops would kill any enemy fleeing the strafing of the aircraft, sweep forward flushing out others hiding in the bush, then advance on the main complex itself. Aircraft meanwhile would continue to pound the camp for as long as necessary.  
To the troops involved, it seemed a straight-forward enough plan. But for the SAS Officer Commanding Major Brian Robinson and Air Force Group Captain Norman Walsh, _Operation Dingo_ was a planners nightmare.  
For the plan to succeed, it was absolutely critical they achieve total surprise. Having at long last got the go-ahead to mount the strikes, the two planners were haunted by the possibility of arriving at the targets to find the enemy were on to them and the camps vacated.  
Yet, how could an armada of noisy aircraft arrive over the target without giving the game away?
If the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, it would send the sounds of the advancing helicopter gunships straight towards the camps. It would give the enemy, whom they hoped to catch unawares, a good ten minutes early warning… long enough to scatter or take cover, and sufficient time to man their anti-aircraft guns in readiness to take on the vulnerable Dakotas flying over the camp at 500 feet.  
So what could be done to maintain their security? How could they outsmart ZANLA whom they planned to attack at their regular 08h00 muster parade when they were at their most vulnerable and concentrated?
Then Norman Walsh hit on an idea. He felt that if the assembled enemy were to hear a jet scream over the camp ten or 15 minutes _before_ the first strike went in, they would break ranks and dive for the safety of their trenches, thinking the Rhodesians were about to attack them.  
When nothing happened, they would take up their positions on the parade square again. Planes were seldom heard in the area and they would probably think it was a stray airliner, it would give them a false sense of security for the time the noise from the real enemy aircraft was heard overhead.  
The Rhodesian planners were banking on the enemy reasoning that as nothing had befallen them the first time around, they would not bother to run for cover a second time. And that would seal their fate.  
The scheme had the virtue of never having been tried before. But would it work? Civilian pilot Captain Jack Malloch, owner of a sanctions-busting airline who was always ready to help out with any security force plan, readily agreed to lend his DC-8 jet and a pilot for the task, which had to be worked out with split-second timing so that ZANLA were back on parade at precisely the time the Rhodesian jets appeared overhead.  
Then another worry. The two planners could not dismiss the awesome prospect that the weather might be against them and they would get to the point of no return to find Chimoio in cloud. The strikes were timed for late November and there was a very real possibility of rains and cloud.  
If - after the noise from the aircraft had alerted the camp to their presence - they then had to turn around ‘and go all the way home without the attack going in, they knew that would be that; they would never get the go-ahead to mount the operation again.  
In addition to their other worries. Brian Robinson - who was to command the ground troops - and Norman Walsh - to command the air effort - would carry a further psychological load.  
The hierarchy had imposed a strict limit on their time across the border, and as they were still concerned about world reaction, they wanted the entire operation over and every man and machine back in Rhodesia in three or four days.  
The two planners would then have the extremely difficult job of organising the extraction phase. Everybody who had parachuted in or had been choppered to the target and all those held in reserve in the forward admin area had to be brought out again.  
They had to bear in mind that they were swinging from an easterly target to a northerly one within 48 hours, which from a logistical manpower and airpower point of view was an enormous problem.  
The mission which was to set a number of operational precedents, would be the first time a senior army and air force officer were to command a major external battle from a helicopter. As far as the planners could see, it would be stupid not to use a helicopter to command the battle. A commander needed to read and feel the battle, and it was difficult to do that if he was not near the target. Previous experience had shown that unless air and ground forces could get a quick response to requests, the battle tended to get bogged down.  
A helicopter would provide the two commanders with the most mobile platform possible. They could fly wherever they wanted, follow the battle around from their elevated position, be more involved in the proceedings and in radio contact with everyone. And as Norman Walsh was a pilot, what could be better than having him fly the chopper and direct the air force side of the operation with Brian Robinson sitting next to him, commanding the ground troops?
An Alouette III was modified to suit their needs and proper radio plugs installed so that they could transmit at the same time but on different networks. Both seats were next to each other and faced forward.  
As well as the command chopper, there was also going to be an Admin Dakota with a command element, although it would have nothing to do with the battle itself. General Walls was to fly in the Admin Dakota, twenty-thirty kilometres ( 12-18 miles) north of the battle zone and his role was to be very much politically-orientated. He would have a direct link via a teleprinter back to the Prime Minister in Salisbury, and his function was to decide such things as what action to lake in the event of FRELIMO scrambling their MiGs.  
Eventually, all the rehearsals and attention to detail were over and it was time for the real thing. The strike planes were bombed up, and the SAS and RLI troops began arriving at New Sarum Air Base, Salisbury. The magnificent model of Chimoio was moved into a hanger and stands arranged around it for everyone who was going to be involved in the operation. Other intelligence information - aerial photographs, maps, charts - were arrayed on boards.  
Then the general, the air marshal, the rest of the brass, and all the soldiers and airmen filed into the hangar and took up their seats to hear Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh give their orders.  
It was certainly a strange way to give orders. Brian Robinson was a major, and yet there he was giving orders to the top brass when it ought to have been the other way around.  
And the orders were thorough and in-depth, catering for most eventualities.  
Although Chimoio housed 13 separate camps, it was out of the question for the Rhodesians to attack them all because of the limited numbers of aircraft available, and SB had been tasked to select the five most important camps to hit.  
The ground troops would he wearing normal Rhodesian camouflage to make them easily identifiable to each other during the battle, and their caps were to be turned inside out to reveal bright orange “dayglo” patches, making them recognisable to the pilots and airborne commanders.  
It was stressed they were not to engage FRELIMO. The raid was against ZANLA only, not their host country’s troops.  
Each para-stick commander had been given written orders and after the two planners gave their overall briefing, the commanders then gave their own detailed orders, telling each member of his stick where he was to be positioned… his fire and movement drills ... who the sub-commanders were ... who was to be the medic...  
Then, to ensure the written orders were followed to the letter, they carded out their battle preparations until everyone knew where to go and what his role in the action was to he.  
The Dakotas carrying the 97 SAS and 48 RLI paratroopers were to fly straight to the target… while the forty helicopter-borne RLI would fly from Lake Alexander. a forward air base a few kilometres from the Mozambican border.  
After the mission, the helicopters and all the troops would exfiltrate through the external admin base, then return home via Lake Alexander and Grand Reef air base.  
Eventually, final equipment requirements were drawn and the forty RLI troops who were to be choppered into the ZANLA camp began the long drive to Lake Alexander to await the arrival of the helicopters.  
Ahead of them went SB officers Pete Stanton and Pete Dewe who were to interrogate prisoners and sift through captured documents. The two men were dressed in police reservists uniforms and the local water bailiff stopped by for a friendly chat.  
“Hello chaps,” he said. “what are you doing here?”
“We’re waiting for some mates,” they replied, explaining they were going to camp by the lake for the night.  
Next morning, the water bailiff passed by again to see the air force knocking white tabs in the ground for the choppers. Later, he saw every helicopter Rhodesia possessed lined up along the lake shore.  
“You _have_ got a lot of friends,” he remarked with a shake of his head when he saw the two SB officers in a restaurant later.

D-Day Minus One was extremely tense for Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh. They had a couple of drinks in the mess to help them doze off, but it didn’t really work and they spent a very restless night.  
They knew only too well that they had planned the enormous in-depth cross-border raid down to the last detail, but as they tossed and turned throughout the long night, they continually quizzed themselves if they had forgotten anything… if it would work… if the enemy would still be there by the time the jets arrived overhead ... And, indeed, if the mission was still on.  
For they could not help sensing even at that late hour, that the hierarchy were still apprehensive about the operation, still uncertain they would be able to get the vast number of kills they claimed.  
Certainly, no one, hierarchy or planners, knew what to expect.  
Sleep eventually overtook Brian and Norman... and when they awoke, it was to find that it had rained during the night. It was their first of many worries that long, eventful day; for they had no idea if the target would be in cloud.  
As the two planners stepped out on to the tarmac that crisp early morning, they were confronted by the magnificent sight of row upon row of camouflaged helicopters lined up on the wet tarmac, all ready for the order to lift off. There were the ten troop carriers, all the K-cars to be used in the attack, and the command chopper.  
They now knew that. except for atrocious weather, there would be no cancellation. They were committed.  
As the incoming flights of aircraft had been arriving at New Sarum from other centres in readiness for the mission. Salisbury folk up early that morning were quick to guess something big was afoot. Those old enough to remember World War II were to liken it to D-Day all over again.  
The pilots climbed into their aircraft, eager to be gone. Then the commander of the Air Force, Air Marshal Frank Mussell came on to the runway to see them off, and at 05h00 on Wednesday, November 23, the pilots started their engines and headed eastwards in waves of five.  
The country’s most audacious pre-emptive mission to date had begun and it was a year to the day since the idea had begun to take shape.  
Elsewhere in New Saturn, the 48 RLI paratroopers from 3 Commando (under the command of Major Gerry Strong BCR) and the 97 SAS operators were fitting on their parachutes, strapping their rifles in place and would soon take up their positions inside the six Dakotas. In Thornhill air base, Gwelo, the bombed-up jets were taxiing on to the tarmac. Soon Jack Malloch’s DC-8 jet would be streaking across the border towards Chimoio.  
Altogether the massive air effort seen over Rhodesian skies that morning totalled 42 helicopters, eight Hunters, six Vampires. three Canberras, six Dakotas and a dozen Lynx’s.

At Lake Alexander, close to the Mozambique border, there was a sudden flurry of activity. The helicopters had landed uneventfully and soon, the refuelling was complete and they were ready for the last leg of the journey to Chimoio.  
The task of leading the armada of helicopters to the target rested squarely on the shoulders of one man, Squadron Leader Harold Griffiths.  
He had made his flight plan and had marked out all his reference points and knew exactly what was going to happen every minute of the journey.  
The forty RLI helicopter-borne troops climbed into ten choppers and the squadron leader’s chopper lifted. Then, one after the other, the rest followed, flying low to get into Mozambique under radar cover.  
As the squadron leader map read and led the way to Mozambique. Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh in their command chopper were questioning each other on codewords and the position of stop groups during the forthcoming battle. After endless weeks of dry runs, it was their first live rehearsal. Next time, it would be for real.  
Just before the armada reached the border, their journey took them through a valley. Suddenly, as the squadron leader led the way down the valley, he was confronted with a blanket of solid cloud. There could be no going on.  
He did a quick U-turn and headed back down the valley… followed by the entire armada. His carefully-laid plans and timings had now been thrown out, and, having been forced to change plans mid-air, he had to virtually map read by the seat of his pants.  
Luckily, the squadron leader found another valley that was clear of cloud, but the detour had cost them precious minutes and the planners immediately began to worry about the fuel situation.  
The DC-8 jet meanwhile, had screamed over Chimoio with taps full open, making as much noise as possible - and the enemy fled for cover, just as the planners had hoped.  
The Dakotas bearing the paratroopers were flying direct from Salisbury and the tension inside the planes was thick.  
SAS captain Colin Willis was thinking that he must have been crazy to leave the safety and security of a job at the School of Infantry to get involved in something like this. This was no small task, and the odds - almost 200 Rhodesians against 9 000 to 11 000 - seemed ridiculous even with surprise and air back-up. As he looked around at the grim, determined faces in the Dakota, he wondered as he often did, who would be coming back.  
As it got nearer to H-hour, the paratroopers were relieved to see they were no longer alone. There was now a multitude of aircraft accompanying them to Chimoio. Jets were passing them, other Dakotas were flying with them, and they in turn were overtaking helicopters.  
The jet pilots were anxious to know what the weather was like into the target. Norman Walsh, flying ahead in the command chopper radioed it was all right although he personally didn’t consider it particularly good.  
The peace and tranquility existing in the biggest war base in Mozambique could now be measured in minutes.  
Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh glanced at their watches once more that morning. It was now almost H-hour.  
In Chimoio, ZANLA were gingerly coming out of their tranches. They thought the jet that had just flown over had heralded the start of a Rhodesian air strike. But nothing happened and they considered themselves safe. By 08h00 they had all taken up their places for their daily muster parade.  
Suddenly, they became aware of an aircraft very high in the air, coming from the south. At first, they thought it might be Samora Machel, the Mozambican President about to pay one of his periodic visits.  
But the base commander was not so sure and he gave the order to dismiss. But by then the bomb doors of the Rhodesian jets had opened and their cargoes were already on their way. The bomb aimers in the Canberras saw a sea of faces looking up at them from the parade square. Then came the “bombs gone”.  
Huge columns of black smoke and dust were enveloping the camp… people were running in every direction… fires were starting all over the complex. The unexpected had happened ... and they had no hope.  
The two men who had planned the mission, sat in the command chopper a few minutes flying time from the camp, anxiously awaiting a quick sitrep to learn if the jets had been on target or not. They glanced at their watches again. It was way past H-hour. Things had still not quietened down sufficiently for the Hunter squadron leader to give his report yet. Finally, Norman Walsh could stand it no longer.  
“Red One,” he said to Richard Brand over the air force net, “were you on target?”
The voice of the squadron leader crackled over the air immediately. “What a question,” the pilot replied reassuringly in a very casual air force drawl.  
After that, the tension went out of the whole thing and the planners knew they were in business. The weather had been okay after all and the DC-8 ploy had enabled them to maintain their security. The swiftness of the assault and the rapidity with which it was pressed home came as a total surprise.  
By now, the SAS and RLI stick commanders in the Dakotas were listening in on their headsets for a blow-by-blow account of what was going on ahead of them. Two minutes from jump time, having removed their headsets and put their helmets on, they heard the deafening crunch of the airstrikes over and above the noise of the Dakotas.  
Now they could see the multi-coloured tracers of anti-aircraft and smallarms fire streaking across the sky towards them.  
The red lights came on and everyone waddled along the fuselages towards the open doorways with characteristic gait, the mood not quite so apprehensive now. As the commanders stood in the doorways, they could see the many satellite complexes sprawled beneath them exactly as in their scale model. The crackle of smallarms fire passing the Dakotas punctuated their thoughts as they prepared to leap out.  
The Dakotas were flying at between 450 and 500 feet, the normal height for operational jumps. Any higher and the descending troops became easy targets; any lower and it would be too hazardous to jump, resulting in heavy casualties.  
They came to the run-in and the green lights went on - and precisely as planned, two minutes after the first air strikes went in, they jumped into Chimoio. And the game was very much on.  
As the command choppers came within range, Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh were confronted with the unbelievable sight of Hunter strikes. Vampire strikes and everything that flew going into the target. Then came the armada of Dakotas and the air was filled with the puffs of countless parachutes.  
Next, the helicopter-borne RLI troops were put down on their side of the camp... and eight minutes later the gunships arrived to close off the cordon. The camp was surrounded and everything was going according to plan.  
(Meanwhile, other troops were being dropped into the forward admin base ten kilometres (six miles) away by the DC-7, to secure the area and await the parachute drop of helicopter fuel.)
As soon as the paratroopers left the Dakotas, they could see the airstrikes going in and by concentrating on them, were able to orientate themselves in relation to their own specific targets.  
After the noise of the Dakota, the static of the headsets and the noise of the airstrikes, the silence was almost deafening as they floated down under their canopies.  
Suddenly, the anti-aircraft gunners were trying to shoot them from the skies. As the ground rushed up to meet them, they could see scores of ZANLA running beneath them.  
“Christ, but these guys can only move,” thought one paratrooper, remembering they had been positioned far enough away from the camp for the enemy to get there _after_ they had landed.  
From the moment they got out of their harnesses, they began engaging the fleeing enemy. They could not shoot and exchange magazines fast enough and within a few minutes of landing, one four-man group had accounted for eighty ZANLA.  
Few ZANLA entertained any serious thoughts of retaliating. They only wanted to get away as fast as possible.  
Several paratroopers landed in trees and were now trying to struggle free of their parachutes and take on the men running beneath them, before they could turn their attention to the soldiers dangling in mid-air above them.  
Captain Colin Willis’s parachute was entangled in two trees and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get out of his predicament. His rifle was still firmly held in place by the body band of his parachute and by the time he had grabbed his pistol, the ten armed enemy running straight towards him were only thirty paces away.  
He blasted away at the men, who by now were running directly beneath him. One man fell mortally wounded at his feet. Realising his commander was going to have a problem, Sergeant Les Clark raced to the rescue and downed six of the nine enemy.  
The pressure now off, Colin swung himself across to one of the trees, released his harness and dropped to the ground, feeling much safer and happier being on the soldier’s normal environment with plenty of good cover around him.  
Now the stop group commanders consolidated their stop lines, took cover and watched and shot. just as their orders had instructed.  
The volume of fire from both attacker and camp defender was intense. The Hunters and K-cars continued to pound the complex with everything they had and the enemy anti-aircraft gunners grimly fought back.  
Within the first five minutes, every aircraft over the target had taken a hit, including the command chopper, and Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh were forced to retire from the battle and return to the forward admin area.  
It was a serious setback. The alternative army commander was on the ground and could not be uplifted because of the thick trees. As he was unable to see the overall picture from his position, he was virtually ineffective and could not control the battle.  
It would be the security forces first lesson of the day. Next time, they knew that the alternative commander needed to be airborne as well. There was now no one to control troop movement other than _The Blues_ and it was an extremely frustrating time for the ground troops who were eager to get to grips with the A/A gunners still firing at the aircraft.  
Back in the admin base, the two planners managed to scrounge a lift in other aircraft and they would use them until the command chopper was repaired and they could get together again.  
The whole episode had cost them a precious thirty minutes when they desperately needed to be over the battle to control it.  
As soon as Brian Robinson appeared over the camp again and started redirecting the battle, the stop lines began pushing through the bush to the main camp. ZANLA were flushed out and only token resistance was offered, their enthusiasm for the armed struggle suddenly wearing very thin. By the time the troops reached the camp, they had several prisoners who were more than happy to cooperate and point out the best routes and hiding places.  
For the rest of the day, the SAS and RLI continued to have battles all over the camp. The enemy were hidden in a variety of places and the soldiers had a job to winkle them out. The A/A gunners only abandoned their positions once the troops closed in.  
There were areas where the two planners had to bring in airstrike after airstrike to try and clear the enemy. The Canberras were to return to the camp several times to deliver their deadly payloads ... the Hunters were going back to Thornhill air base, Gwelo, to refuel and return to strike their targets time after time… and the helicopter gunships bustled back and forth to the nearby admin area to refuel and rearm before going back to Chimoio.  
As one SAS group advanced on the ZANLA garage, the enemy opened fire. Corporal Trevor Kershaw looked to see if the sweepline was straight, and as he did so, a single shot struck the man next to him between the eyes.  
The stick commander bellowed to his men to get down and take off their dayglo caps, for that was what the enemy were shooting at. The SAS sank to earth. But there was no cover and the enemy were still shooting at them. While Sergeant Phil Cripps sent out an urgent request for the casevac chopper and a K-car to flush out the enemy, another man crawled towards the injured soldier, who had now stopped breathing.  
With the enemy still firing at them, he gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and breathed life back into Frans Nel while the medic sorted out the drips. But thirty minutes later, Frans was dead. A K-car arrived to strafe the area, and when all fell silent. Frans and a couple of other injured men were lifted out.  
Inside the command helicopter - repaired and back over the battle within a few hours - the amount of radio traffic filtering through the chopper was phenomenal.  
There were 64 individual army radio stations alone and scores of air force ones, and the two commanders had to handle all requests for casevac, ammunition resupply and air strikes. These in turn were channelled through the Admin Dakota which acted as the airborne link to the external admin and main bases in Lake Alexander, Grand Reef, Salisbury and Thornhill, from where support would be forthcoming.  
Although the commanders were transmitting on different channels, they could not separate them and it meant they were listening to everything at once.  
During the day, a FRELIMO reaction force positioned at Vanduzi Crossroads fired at a Vampire piloted by Flight-Lieutenant Philip Haigh. He got the plane back to Rhodesia but was killed in a crash landing.

The din of the battle had died down now and towards last light on that first day in Chimoio, an SAS corporal shinned up a tree and held aloft the green and white flag of Rhodesia, just to show who was in charge.  
As darkness descended, the troops were put into defensive positions and settled down for the night. There were several contacts with ZANLA who stumbled in on them and several were killed when they wandered into the buildings, thinking the Rhodesians had gone home.  
But there had been no sign of the leadership element and if the top commanders were there, they certainly did not stay to rally their men.  
The wife of Edgar Tekere, destined to become an outspoken and controversial figure in Zimbabwe politics, managed to escape detection by standing in the communal latrine for three days.  
By now, the wounded were staggering towards Chimoio town and the press would soon be on to the raid. Back home, security was tight. The operation was not yet over and the Rhodesians would have to wait for details.  
![SAS Logo](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Images/SAS%20Logo.png)  
Next morning the stop groups began re-sweeping their previous days’ targets and destroying whatever was still standing.  
Captain Bob McKenna and his team moved down to the main transport area to find twenty vehicles in various states of repair. One belonged to Robert Mugabe and the sticker on another told it had been serviced at a Salisbury garage a few days before.  
They destroyed the ZANLA workshop, petrol tank, then used the sole remaining vehicle, a Peugeot pick-up truck, to collect the anti-aircraft guns, which were to be taken back to Rhodesia.  
The distances between the various anti-aircraft positions were vast and Bob and his team reckoned they got to see more of the battlefield than anyone else. They collected seven 12,7 millimetre guns, and destroyed a Chinese 37 millimetre twin-barrelled anti-aircraft gun which was too heavy to take back home.  
Finally, it was all over and the Rhodesians began to leave Chimoio. Men, kit, the captured weapons and a mountain of documents were, bit by bit, pulled back to the forward admin base ... then to Lake Alexander... and on to Grand Reef Air Base, Umtali.  
![185 - dingo](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/185%20-%20dingo.png)  
It was almost dark when they began their approach to Grand Reef. A long line of navigational fairy lights twinkled far into the distance. The armada was on its way home and phase two was about to begin.  
![SAS Logo](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Images/SAS%20Logo.png)  
The attack on Tembue recruit camp north of Cabora Bassa was virtually the same as for Chimoio - a vertical envelopment by parachute.  
The only difference was that Tembue was divided into two camps and it was impossible to box both camps off individually as the enemy on both sides would have been able to shoot at the paratrooper stoplines in the centre. The strafing from the aircraft would complete the box instead.  
Except for one helicopter and one Vampire less, they were going to have the full complement of aircraft. Those planes which had taken hits on Chimoio had all been repaired.  
Within 24 hours of completing the Chimoio raid, phase two was underway. The choppers and crews had a night-stop at the Rhodesian forward admin base at Mtoko, then early next morning it was on to the target 225 kilometres (140 miles) inside Mozambique, stopping only at the external admin base on _The Train_ the flat-topped mountain south of Cabora Bassa, to refuel.  
The paratroopers flew straight from Salisbury... and as Sergeant Dale O’Mulligan exited his plane, he counted to four and waited for his canopy to open. It didn’t. He pulled the ripcord on his reserve and that didn’t open either, for by now he was too close to the ground.  
With his parachute streaming behind him and the ground rushing up to meet him, it looked like the end for Dale. But at the very last moment, his parachute became entangled in a tree pulling him up with a jerk just before he was about to smash into the ground.  
The very relieved soldier could hardly believe his good fortune. He lowered himself to earth, brushed himself down and got on with the war.  
The two planners were fearful that they would arrive at the camp to find it had been deserted, but their worries were unfounded. The Chimoio raid had not served as early-warning of further Rhodesian aggressive intentions - and as the camouflaged war planes emerged from behind the trees, the terrified enemy ran in every direction.  
The ground troops established the best cordon they could and began sweeping towards the centre of the camp, flushing out the enemy… while, elsewhere, the constant chatter of helicopter gunships heralded the arrival of yet another airstrike.  
“A” Troop commander Bob McKenna moved down a gully on his way to the camp. It was too quiet for his liking and there was a feeling of danger about the place. With his finger curled around the trigger of his AR-15 he moved cautiously. Suddenly, there came the sound of a rock as it bounced down the cliff face. He looked up to see six ZANLA armed with ten-round SKSs waiting in ambush for him high above in a little cave.  
The SAS commander fired from the hip, killing all six before any had time to get off a single shot. The six bodies and their rifles clattered down from the cave and landed at the officer’s feet. He changed magazines and continued on his way.  
Later, in another gully, Bob, Sergeant Les Clark and Trooper Gerry McGahan came face to face with a large group of enemy.  
Standing back-to-back, the three soldiers blazed away while the enemy fled into the bush and dived for cover. Fortunately for the Rhodesians, Bob and Les carried automatic rifles, and Gerry an RPD light-machinegun, in the whole of the war, the three men had never fired so rapidly or changed magazines so quickly.  
The contact lasted three minutes and by the time they had finished and other troops had arrived to help, 86 enemy lay dead. There were three SAS men who could be forgiven for thinking they had won the war single-handed.  
There was a FRELIMO presence three kilometres to the north in Tembue town, but helping their ZANLA comrades was the last thing on their minds. The Rhodesians could see them through their binoculars as they stood on their roofs watching the proceedings - and cheering.  
Ten kilometres away in the Rhodesian-owned admin base, technicians were examining a chopper which had taken a hit. Their verdict: if it was to fly again, it would need a new engine. Unusual though it was to change an engine in the field, it had to be done. A new engine was flown in, and then, standing on a fuel drum, the technicians took the rotor blades off, changed the engine and made it serviceable again - and did it all in six hours.  
By late afternoon, SB came up with a capture who reported another camp thirty kilometres (18 miles) to the north where 500 trained ZANLA were holed up. The information came too late in the day for a full-scale camp attack, but at 17h00 the Canberras made a single run and the pilots reported the strike had been successful.  
By evening, the RLL SAS and the Air Force had the camp fairly well buttoned up although the odd ZANLA could be seen darting furtively from cover to cover. Most of the troops got back into the choppers, leaving Bob McKenna and his small group to be uplifted last.  
As the choppers flew home in waves, one began to run short of fuel as it approached Cabora Bassa. Norman Walsh, flying behind in the command chopper, got the pilot to put down on a tiny island in the middle of the lake, then asked Jack Malloch in the DC-7 to come around and drop four drums of fuel off for them. The drop went without a hitch and several of the choppers hovered around the island while the pilot topped up his plane. Then he gave the thumbs up sign, and off they went heading south again.  
There was a refuelling stop on _The Train_ admin base, then they set course for home. But there was a massive line of storms, and many choppers began to run low on fuel. Everyone tried to make it back to Mount Darwin, instead of the small emergency forward admin base right on the border, but the weather that pitch black night was filthy and a dozen choppers went missing.  
The first wave managed to get over the escarpment and were landing in various clubs around Centenary ... and when club members suddenly saw the red navigational lights coming through the blackness from the direction of Mozambique, they believed it to be a Mugabe invasion force.  
The second wave which included the command chopper could only make it as far as Chizweti. Brian Robinson and Norman Walsh clambered out of the chopper into the pelting rain, then hurried straight to the pub where they proceeded to get screaming drunk. Five days of constant worry and tension were over. The mission had been a success and a few days’ R and R lay ahead.  
Meanwhile, Bob McKenna and his men were still far away in Tembue and after a night when the silence was repeatedly broken by the sound of FRELIMO vehicles and heavy machineguns firing north of Tembue town, they were uplifted and flown home without incident.  
As the waves of helicopters returned to Salisbury carrying home the fatigued yet triumphant soldiers, Rhodesians greeted their safe return and heralded their success by flashing their car lights and throwing their hats in the air.  
The ComOps’ switchboard was jammed by calls from Rhodesians eager to congratulate the commanders of the two raids. Major Brian Robinson, MCM, and Group Captain Norman Walsh, BCR, were to be made Officers of the Legion of Merit - for distinguished service to Rhodesia - for their planning of the raid.  
Operation Dingo had been a spectacular success. It had been a classic example of a meticulously planned and brilliantly executed joint security force operation. It was the biggest kill rate of any camp attack of the war more than 2 000 enemy had been killed and several thousand others wounded.  
Both camps had been decimated, vast quantities of weapons destroyed and captured, and the mountain of captured documents was to keep SB busy for nine months sifting through it. There was so much they had to empty prisoners out of three of Umtali’s police cells to store it in. The documents gave a tremendous amount of information on ZANLA’s internal operations and routes and the security forces were kept busy for months waylaying and killing gangs.  
The Rhodesians had lost one soldier and one airman and eight men had been wounded. Considering the odds. they had been extremely lucky. Despite their success, ComOps were still worried about world opinion and sat for days waiting to see what would happen.  
Dr David Owen, the British Foreign Secretary, while condemning the raid as a “savage and pretty brutal attack.” said “it might show the PF that the Rhodesian defence force is simply not on its back.”
As expected, ZANLA went running to the United Nations, and claimed that innocent women and children had been killed. Although unable to take a seat at the UN, the Rhodesians were able to answer the allegations with documentary and photographic evidence.  
There had certainly been teenagers at the camp, but from the blackboards the soldiers found, it was clear they had not been studying the three Rs. It was Marxism and the theory of smallarms fire that had been on their timetable.  
Eight captured photographs showed a platoon of women practising rifle drills with fixed bayonets. There were pictures of women in camouflaged steel helmets grouped around a 12,7 millimetre anti-aircraft machinegnn and another showed Josiah Tongogara and two women wielding AK rifles. There was one document which listed the Chimurenga names of eighty women.  
On the subject of civilians inside the camps, a memorandum by ZANLA commander, Bataimoyo Munhukwayie read: “There is a problem of Mozambican masses staying within the camp, where they indulge in magical affairs, but getting them to leave is difficult.”
The Rhodesians concede that there were many unarmed people at Chimoio, but that the soldiers were not there to take chances. In some contacts, it was found that the enemy were armed with folding butt FN rifles, and when cornered put up heavy resistance.  
The raid was labelled a massacre by many critics. But the security forces point out it must not be forgotten that Chimoio was a terror base and the people there, if not already trained, were destined to become the next crop of ZANLA infiltrators, whose role was to sally forth and terrorise Rhodesians.  
Indeed, as General Walls explained: “We are fighting for law and order here and you cannot just sit back and let bases like that exist. Yes, we will continue to operate behind enemy lines.” He added that if there were women in the camps, “then we just have to accept that we might kill some women.”
As for the survivors, their morale was completely broken. They now knew that it was no longer safe to hide deep inside Mozambique and the fear of being involved in anything similar was very real indeed and would haunt them for years to come.  
As a bonus for the Rhodesians, the raid served to sow the seeds of discontent within the ZANLA central committee and high command.  
Trouble had been brewing for some time and the leader of a dissident group, Cleotus Chigowe, and his supporters were not satisfied with the way the high command was running the war. Chigowe blamed the losses at Chimoio on Mugabe’s complacency, accusing him of failing to arm some of the occupants for fear of being overthrown by the dissidents.  
Then, with morale at rock bottom, the rebels plotted a coup to topple Mugabe.  
However, Edgar Tekere persuaded FRELIMO to arrest two dissidents and when word reached Chigowe, he captured Tekere and Dr Herbert Ushewokonze, tied them to trees and beat them. Mugabe supporters in turn rescued their comrades, ambushed the rebel leader and several supporters ... and FRELIMO finally stepped in and rounded up forty rebels.  
The coup was foiled, but what with one thing and another, all was not well in the Mugabe camp...
