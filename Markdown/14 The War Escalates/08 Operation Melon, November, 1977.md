By October, a new tactical picture was developing in south-east Mozambique.
FRELIMO who were already very aggressive, now intended getting even tougher with the Rhodesian security forces. They were more than a little upset at the Rhodesians’ continued presence in Gaza Province and had instructed all units to engage actively and rout the border-hopping Rhodesians.
They also intended supplying as much war material and spiritual assistance as possible to their ZANLA comrades.
For Rhodesia’s security forces operating against ZANLA’s entry and resupply routes in the province, it had become increasingly difficult to distinguish between FRELIMO and ZANLA. The more ZANLA was attacked, the closer they moved into the FRELIMO confines - and the more the _Freds_ protected them.
And ZANLA, realising the obvious benefits to be obtained by travelling the roads with their FRELIMO friends, were in the process of switching from using civilian buses and other forms of transport to the relative security of travelling in FRELIMO convoys.
It was a dilemma which was becoming more and more frustrating to SAS commanders and their troops as they vainly tried to stick to the Rhodesian Government policy of leaving FRELIMO alone ... whilst at the same time, always hitting positively identified ZANLA targets.
Then at the end of October, the radio interceptors tipped the SAS off about a six-vehicle ZANLA convoy which was on its way from Maputo docks to Mapai, the major military FRELIMO garrison in Gaza. Thereafter, it would travel onwards to the border carrying ZANLA commanders and reinforcements straight to the southeastern operational area of Rhodesia.
It was a ZANLA only convoy, and as an added bonus, the vehicles were brand new. It was certainly an opportunity not to be missed… and Captain Colin Willis and 15 other men were immediately deployed to the forward operational base at Mabalouta in the south-east to prepare for the mission.
At 18h00 on November 1, they boarded a Dakota and crossed the border, flying low, and pursuing a zig-zag course, a routine procedure carried out in the south-east to confuse any observers as to their true destination, and to infiltrate under FRELIMO radar cover which was capable of picking up aircraft movement within a 160 kilometre radius of Mapai. Their DZ was 120 kilometres (75 miles) into Mozambique and they were well within that radius.
At 19h00, the 16 men leapt into space from 500 feet above ground level ... while above them, “A” Troop commander Captain Bob McKenna strained his eyes to watch as his men floated gently through the twilight, before landing safely in an open pan in the middle of a sandalwood forest.
The Dakota, still flying low, droned on its way through the darkness, and every so often, the aerial resupply dispatchers threw out alpha bombs - small 1 kilogram steel balls which bounced before exploding in the air - a ploy to convince the enemy that the Dakota was on a bombing mission, _not_ a parachute run.
The Dakota turned, then headed for home.
Some fifteen minutes later, the pilot saw a fire glowing through the darkness. The night had come down suddenly and the fire was the only thing visible through the gloom of the evening.
Ahead lay FRELIMO’s Mapai garrison, but all was quiet and there was not so much as a chink of light to be seen.
The aerial resupply dispatchers disgorged another cluster of alpha bombs to give the chaps sitting around the little camp fire a rude awakening, then the Dak continued on its way.
Suddenly, all hell was let loose inside the plane.
The pilots had unintentionally overflown Mapai, and the enemy gunners, having been alerted to the Rhodesians’ presence by the last drop of exploding alpha bombs, were ready and waiting for them.
A barrage of bullets, green tracer and flak poured through the cockpit, zinging down the fuselage, narrowly missing the aerial dispatchers and gouging holes in the plane.
Alloy was pinging in every direction from the effects of FRELIMO’s 23 millimetre anti-aircraft shells, 12,7 millimetre heavy machinegun rounds and smallarms fire.
The co-pilot was blasted out of his seat in some sort of instinctive muscular spasm, and crashed on to the controls. The next barrage of rounds went through the plane’s direction finder and aluminium sliced through Bob McKenna’s face.
The plane meanwhile had dived from 500 feet and was heading straight to earth. Bob McKenna and SAS officer Percy Johnson, who were both standing in the cockpit, were thrown off balance and now lay on the floor staring in horror at each other.
The commotion about them prevented their sharing their fears aloud, but each was convinced that both pilots had been killed - and that they were heading for a crash.
Suddenly, just 200 feet above the ground came a miracle. The plane began pulling out of its dive and when the two SAS men looked up it was to see that the pilot was still very much alive and in control of his plane.
The dive had merely been a brilliant evasive action to get them clear of the antiaircraft fire. And by the time the FRELIMO A/A gunners had adjusted to the Dakota’s new range and altitude, the Rhodesians had made good their escape.
By the time the Dakota pulled away. the co-pilot had pulled himself up from the control panel and had clambered back into his seat and both pilots were busily checking the plane was still flying and would get them safely across the border.
Fortunately, there were no fires on board and their main worry was the damaged direction finder. They started to map-read their way home and although the going was a bit rough and it took some considerable time, the plane managed to limp back to Buffalo Range airstrip.
On landing, the shaken pilots and passengers immediately jumped out and rushed to the mess for a quick drink to regain their composure and celebrate their good fortune.
Next morning, they found 23 holes, some as big as a man’s fist. had been punched into the plane. A bullet had also cracked the cylinder head of an engine. They had been extremely lucky and they would remember not to go near Mapai again in a hurry.

Meanwhile, Captain Colin Willis and his team of 15 paratroopers, having cached their chutes, were on their way to the main Mapai-Maputo road, a trek of 15 kilometres (nine miles), which had to be completed by first light.
The ZANLA convoy was expected two nights after the drop, giving the SAS ambushers one night’s buffer time to establish their trap.
By 10h00 on November 2, they had found a reasonable place to site their ambush ... and as the mine-laying party set to, the men in one of the early-warning positions saw two FRELIMO and one ZANLA strolling along the road. The SAS opened fire, but the thick bush prevented them downing the enemy with their first shots and a small fight developed between the enemies. However, the exchange was swiftly over and three ZANLA lay dead on the road.
Colin realised that since the contact may well have been heard by FRELIMO troops on duty at the various sidings along the main road, there was a very real possibility that the enemy, who were particularly active after any air activity, would now have positive evidence they were in the vicinity and would come looking for them.
There was nothing for it. The SAS would just have to pull out and look for another site. Luckily, they still had some buffer time, enough to allow them to move a healthy distance away and set up the ambush all over again and still be within the time frame to catch the convoy.
The bodies were left on the road and booby-trapped: and some mines were left. The troops gathered their belongings and pulled out, eager to put at least 15 kilometres (nine miles) between their original ambush site and their new one.
But they had travelled only four kilometres when the sounds of heavy vehicles could be heard adding weight to Colin’s worst suspicions. All along he had been worried that the convoy would come on the first night, not the second, and they would miss the chance to ambush it.
And now it was too late to set up another ambush. The convoy would be on top of them before they could complete their preparations. There was little they could do but wait and hope.
Still their landmine was in place at the old ambush site and they were in with a chance of hitting at least one vehicle and halting the convoy long enough for them to dash back and get to grips with the remainder.
As the vehicles rolled closer through the early evening, it was becoming apparent that it was no ordinary convoy. The noise told there had to be far more than the six ZANLA trucks they were expecting. It was becoming obvious it was a well-disciplined military convoy of some considerable size and importance.
The 16 SAS men could only assume that the extra numbers meant it was a joint ZANLA/FRELIMO convoy travelling together for protection. They were not to know it then. but it would prove a much bigger prize altogether.
An enormous, but not unexpected, thunderclap reached them across the bush as their landmine and claymores exploded. At least, they consoled themselves, they had scored one hit.
But moments later, the initial blast was followed by an even bigger secondary explosion. For FRELIMO and ZANLA had made the foolish mistake of putting an ammunition truck at the head of their convoy - and were to suffer dearly for it.
The truck and its contents continued to blaze away fiercely for the next few hours, preventing other vehicles getting past the burning, exploding obstacle.
Over and above the sounds of the explosions, other noises told their story. Vehicles were revving, moving to and fro and lights were going on and off. The enemy, having decided against returning back down the road in the direction they had come, were basing up for the night and were moving into some sort of defensive or protective formation. The enemy commanders no doubt hoped that the fire still raging in the ammunition truck would burn itself out, and they would be able to continue their journey the following morning.
For the SAS watching and listening to the fireworks from down the road, it was another opportunity not to be missed.
If they could be allowed to direct strike aircraft on to the extremely vulnerable convoy, it would indeed be a prize target for the Air Force.
By the watery light of the moon, Colin Willis instructed the signaller to send a detailed report using the Morse code giving their location and the estimated strength of the convoy to the tactical HQ at Mabalouta. Then he asked for the men of No 1 Squadron, the Rhodesian Air Force to come and join the punch-up.
The information was passed back to the SAS headquarters and ComOps, and within thirty minutes he had received a reply, it was ‘affirmative’.
The SAS moved in closer to the road to give a better target indication to the aircraft and to get themselves in an ambush position to stop any vehicles fleeing past them.
Then, with the ammunition truck continuing to explode into the nighL they settled down to await first light.

As dawn approached, sounds of activity could be heard coming from the direction of the convoy. Vehicles were manoeuvring into the cover of the bush, as the enemy commanders, realising their vulnerability, began to prepare for a visit from the Rhodesian war planes. For the ammunition truck was still burning, and it was still impossible for them to get past.
At first light, although they could not see it, the SAS could hear the drone of a Rhodesian Lynx high overhead. All vehicle movement down below ceased immediately.
As soon as the Lynx got within radio range, Colin established communications with “A” Troop commander Bob McKenna on board the plane and began giving him a sitrep. Using the burning ammunition truck as a reference point, the ground commander indicated the area where the convoy vehicles were hiding
“We haven’t got them visual yet. There are too many trees,” pilot Flight-Lieutenant Giles Porter radioed Colin. “We’re coming around again for a closer look... We need to get a bit lower,” he added.
But Bob McKenna, who had read the danger in his ground commander’s voice, wasn’t so sure that was a good idea. “Well, I’m staying up here on a cloud,” he was heard to mumble in the background.
Giles Porter descended to treetop level and flew up the road. passing the SAS position and heading straight towards the blazing ammunition truck.
As the Lynx closed on the target, the clear, still morning was rent by the deafening roar of some 400 automatic rifles, several 23 miilimetre anti-aircraft guns, machineguns and assorted missiles including Strela.
One moment the SAS party down the road saw the Lynx, the next it had disappeared into a billowing black cloud of flak, as the full wrath of the enemy was brought to bear on the pilot, his passenger and plane in what had to rate as the heaviest concentration of firepower Colin had witnessed during the long bitter war.
As for pilot Giles Porter and SAS commander Bob McKenna, they thought their last hour had come. For Bob, it was the second such feeling in two days. But there is no substitute for luck and the pilot deftly managed to pull his plane safely away. Amazingly, neither it nor the men on board had taken a single hit.
Down the road, Colin gulped and turned to tell his 15 men to dig in. But they needed no telling. With hundreds of heavily armed enemy just a few kilometres away from them, the odds suddenly didn’t seem so good any more and they were already furiously digging.
Then the Hunters swept in, locating their targets from the muzzle flashes of the weapons firing at the Lynx, and from the windscreens reflecting in the early-morning sunlight a point the enemy had overlooked when attempting to hide their vehicles.
By the time the Hunters had done their first few strikes, the scene below them resembled something out of a Viet Nam movie. Ammunition trucks were burning and exploding, terrorist rockets were zig-zagging all over the show, the wrecks of vehicles were cartwheeling in every direction and there were massive fireballs everywhere.
The smoke from the Hunters’ 30 millimetre guns added to the spectacle and often, as one Hunter swooped in to attack and a truck blew up behind it, the second supporting Hunter would be flying through the debris exploding from the first strike. For the next five hours an intense and spectacular land/air battle raged.
The Hunters kept up the momentum, making strike after strike, hitting the vehicles, with one pair of planes replacing the next as their weaponry was exhausted and their time overhead ran out, and they had to return to base to rearm and refuel in readiness for their next strike ... and the defenders grimly hitting back with everything they had.
After the fourth strike, the SAS raiders decided discretion was the better part of valour and leaving _The Blues_ to sort out the convoy, they vacated their holes and quickly moved away from the road.
A very strong follow-up group, making use of a 12,7 millimetre anti-aircraft gun mounted on wheels, was soon hot on their spoor, highly upset that the small SAS team had managed to cause such havoc.
Colin Willis and crew were determined to shake off the enemy and find a lying-up point where they could lay low for a couple of days and let the heat die down before returning to ambushing road traffi~
They were careful not to leave spoor but, as always in the south-east, the ground was such that anti-tracking was impossible in some places… and in those areas, they booby-trapped their spoor and left a few other surprises scattered around to discourage the enemy.
A couple of times they heard their booby traps go off. They hoped it was to the detriment of the enemy, but as it also served as a reminder that the hunt was still on, they got moving again.
They set up a small base in the escarpment of the Limpopo River and on the fourth day when everything had gone quiet, they were ordered to return to their DZ forty kilometres away to await uplift. In view of the success of the operation, the powers-that-be decided to pull them out and let things die down for a while.
But as they made their way back to the DZ, their radio told that ComOps now wanted them to get back to the scene of the holocaust to make an accurate assessment of the damage inflicted on the convoy… how many vehicles and who exactly was involved ...
It was not the most popular request with the ground troops and Colin was annoyed that they were being asked to carry out a reconnaissance, particularly as an aerial photograph could well have sufficed with no risk to life.
Having seen the large number of troops involved and the intensity of their firepower, no one was particularly keen to go skulking around in the target area and bumping into large groups of determined enemy who were clearly better organised and trained than the ones they normally encountered.
But orders were orders and Colin sent 12 men back to the DZ to unearth the parachutes, while he and three others returned to the target area. He felt that a smaller group would be much easier to control, easier to avoid trouble and less likely to stumble into the enemy.
They were extremely apprehensive about encountering a still very active and highly upset enemy and it took them a further day of very slow. cautious movement to ease into the target area.
That night, it was a very careful group of SAS men indeed who closed in on the black hulks of wrecked vehicles. They were half expecting to find an aggressive reception party lying in wait for them.
But there was no one and nothing had been left buried in the scorched soil to take them unawares. They were greeted only be an eerie silence and a scene of utter devastation. After the apprehension of returning to the scene the four SAS men experienced a feeling of almost comic relief to find the place totally devoid of enemy.
Around them lay the remains of what had been a convoy of brand new vehicles. All told, there were 21 damaged vehicles. Only one had managed to flee from the carnage.
They found a mobile operations centre, and the more they looked around, the more obvious it became that they and their Air Force friends had taken on the whole FRELIMO 4th Brigade HQ (Mobile), which had been moving up to Mapai in compliance with their orders to supply closer support to ZANLA and to set up a forward base to conduct the war against Rhodesian security forces.
They found enough evidence to convince them the convoy was led, managed and organised by Russian advisers. It was the first time that the Rhodesians had seen definite proof that the Russians were operating in Mapai.
The SAS collected much incriminating evidence from the debris of the Russians’ presence, including Russian uniforms and numerous documents. The Russian/Spanish dictionaries they found, also indicated there had been a Cuban presence.
The damage inflicted by the air strikes was virtually complete and the four soldiers were gratified to see the amount of brand new Russian trucks, trailers, fuel and water bowsers, operations and command centres, support weapons and spares which had been rendered useless on their first trip from the docks.
There were also bogies, track and ammunition for T34 tanks, making it the first indication of tanks in Gaza Province - and the first time tanks had been found so close to any Rhodesian border.
Colin assessed that a few of the vehicles could be repaired and just to prevent that happening, the Hunters screamed in a few days later to put them out of action for good.
The SAS also found evidence of a ZANLA presence in the form of two trucks, the remains of which carried ZANLA literature, uniforms and documents.
There was only one body. but the evidence of used medical equipment, bloodied uniforms and helmets with skin attached to them, indicated that many had been wounded or killed ... and subsequent intelligence revealed there had been fifty casualties.
Colin and his small team radioed their findings to ComOps, then, after dodging a couple of FRELIMO patrols, rejoined the rest of their group. They were uplifted and recovered to Rhodesia without incident, the enemy and their Soviet advisers in the _Russian Front_ having been dealt a very severe blow indeed.
