ZANLA had no sooner gathered their belongings and their thoughts and moved from the ruins of Chioco garrison into the nearby town, than the SAS were back in the area again.
Having made the garrison untenable, they now planned to do the same with the entire town, which ZANLA shared with FRELIMO.
They were to harass the area and give the occupants the jitters...  take it over for themselves, then raze it to the ground so it was no longer viable as a staging area.
Initially four callsigns, led by Captain Dave Dodson, were deployed into the area after a very long approach march...  and within a day, three explosions had rocked the neighbourhood as the enemy kept blowing themselves up on SAS landmines. The trouble-makers continued skulking around the neighbourhood on a glorified anti-tracking exercise, laying landmines and periodically making mischief.
They were on the move the whole time and walked endless kilometres. But that really was what SAS work was all about. To outsmart the enemy, they had to keep ahead...  keep a low profile ... be devious ...
Having caused a fair amount of alarm and despondency, the commander decided that the time had come to get into town. They were expecting to find some thirty ZANLA and FRELIMO in residence and a much stronger assault force was needed ... and they moved away from Chioco to await the arrival of a dozen reinforcements, who were to parachute in that night.
The Dakota came in nice and low. Its landing lights flashed once and the ground troops picked up the signal, immediately hurrying to mark out the dropping zone with their hand-held strobe lights.
The 12 reinforcements, led by Mac McIntosh, launched themselves into the night, and the main force followed their progress as the chutes cracked open and they floated gently to the earth. They cached the parachutes, gathered up their weapons of war, and set off immediately, snaking their way through the bush to Chioco, walking for most of the night and stopping only for a few hours to wait for the moon to come up.
As the 28 men silently approached the town, they passed the site of one of their antitank mines. But the mine was no longer there and in its place was just.a gaping crater and bits and pieces of vehicle strewn around.
But by now, the locals’ earlier SAS-initiated troubles seemed to be over and everything had quietened down. The street lights were on and the generator was ticking over smoothly. It all looked very peaceful.
The mortar team and protection party crossed a small wooden bridge at the bottom of the town and went off into the maize field to set up their two 60 millimetre mortars. Everyone else followed, dropping off packs and mortar bombs.
Then the assault force moved in closer to the town and lined up in a large rainwater drain, in readiness for the attack.
The stench in the drain was atrocious, yet they had no option but to put up with it until daybreak. Only then would they realise they had spent part of the night in the community latrine. Never had their Who Dares Wins motto been tested more fully.
SAS trooper Manny Carvalho, who had grown up in Mozambique, was rather looking forward to getting into Chioco. He had been there in the old days when it had boasted a thriving Portuguese community. It was ironic that his return visit was to blow the place off the face of the earth.
Within a couple of hours, the eastern sky began to grey and it was time for the attack.
The commander waved the advance and the SAS came out of the twilight.
Now the smell from the drain was forgotten as they advanced on Chioco in two separate extended lines. Behind them in the maize field, the mortar teams took up their positions to deal with any interference and give the attackers’ support as they swept through the enemy town.
Ben Robins and his team were to destroy the buildings and neutralise any opposition on the right-hand side of the town, while Mac McIntosh and his men took care of those on the left. Once all resistance had been overcome and the town secured. Dave Dodson was to set up his command post in the town.
Chioco sprawled before them, calm and still. It was a typical olde-worlde town with a tree-line boulevard, which stretched roughly the length of two rugby fields. It boasted a dozen buildings on both sides of the main road. which led north to Tete and south to Rhodesia.
There were a couple of two and three-bedroomed houses, a post office, a hall, a meteorological station with radio masts, a water tower, an administrative building where the mayor lived, and a large civilian complex...  and all served by a cantina and a brand new shop.
There was an old disused airstrip at the far end of the town, too, but as the SAS had found on their previous visit. FRELIMO had taken the precaution of scattering old fuel drums along it to prevent Rhodesian war planes landing there.
As the SAS closed on the silent town, Trooper Manny Carvalho could see that Chioco was no longer the quaint little town of his childhood haunts. Gone were the manicured lawns and trim flowerbeds of the good old Portuguese days.
Now, Chioco was neglected, overgrown, pathetic ... Still there was no time for nostalgia and it didn’t really matter anyway. They were about to reduce it to even more of a shambles than it already was.
On the signal the attack went in.
Mac McIntosh tossed a bunker bomb into the first building on his side...  and everyone in his team doubled around behind it to take cover. Bunker bombing never did much good to a building and the explosion tore into the house, shattering the silence of the morning; heralding the SAS’s arrival.
On the opposite side of the road, two men lobbed bunker bombs into a three-bedroomed building and ducked behind the wall. There was an almighty thunderclap and the house collapsed like a pack of cards.
The walls crashed down on the two men. and the corrugated roof lifted and flew through the air, winging its way back to earth at speed. Luckily. no one was in its path to be neatly sliced in half and it clattered into the dust uneventfully.
Groggily, the two operators climbed from the rubble and brushed themselves down. They were a bit bruised and battered by the experience but much relieved at their lucky escape.
Then, with chilling precision, the SAS advanced down the high street, throwing their bunker bombs and lobbing their grenades. They worked in tandem, in a fluid motion, each team destroying a building at the same time as the other...  while the mortar crew in the maize fields behind them, increased the range of their two mortars and blasted ahead at a safe distance, giving covering fire.
Masonry was falling, tin was clattering and belching clouds of smoke filled the streets. And behind from the maize field came the crump of mortars. Everywhere there was chaos and commotion.
Yet amazingly, there was no return fire and no resistance. Chioco appeared deserted, which made their takeover of the town a bit disappointing. It was always more interesting when someone shot back.
Undaunted, they continued sweeping through the buildings, meticulously clearing each one, shooting in every possible hiding place, before ducking out and progressing to the next building, just in case FRELIMO and ZANLA were keeping a low profile. But there was no sign of anyone.
In less than half an hour, the SAS had swept right through the town and by the time they had finished, all that remained standing were pock-marked shells.
On the commander’s orders, they put a rocket into the cantina and within seconds, the place was ablaze, exploding _Coca Cola_ bottles adding to the confusion of the morning.
Next to nothing was salvaged from the cantina, but luckily the store next door escaped unscathed and they were able to rescue a few tins of food and milk and a few bottles of _Manica_ beer - at least enough for a celebration.
There was only one victim of their takeover that day and that was a chicken which had made the fatal mistake of hanging around town; it became the star attraction at the party.
With the SAS out and about the countryside, the other occupants had left town and were now sleeping in the thick bush, not twenty metres from the SAS mortar position. The SAS’s harassing programme had given them the jitters and they had taken the precaution of not being caught in their buildings at first light, a popular time for the SAS to strike.
By the time they awoke and got organised, the commotion had died down and Chioco was under the complete control of the SAS.
As the enemy opened up on the SAS mortar team, something exploded into the tree next to the startled crew. A sergeant leapt over one man to get to the mortar, swung it around, popped a few bombs into the barrel and without knowing exactly where the problem lay, blasted away at where he thought the enemy were.
All fell silent and there was no more trouble from that quarter.
The sergeant had scored a direct hit. Later, they would find one man with his foot blown off and in a dazed state. Webbing thick with congealed blood told that another victim bad taken a chest wound before being carted away.
In the town, the salvaged food was being ferried from the store in preparation for the victory celebrations. The commander tasked Ben Robins and Mac McIntosh to finish demolishing Chioco, and for them, it was back to work with a promise of a share of the goodies later.
The others, meanwhile, had found some old easy chairs and a table in the mayor’s house, and. with the commander’s permission, dragged them outside.
Next came a teapot, cups and saucers and fine white linen. They set the table under the shade of a tree, spread out the tablecloth and laid the cutlery.
Someone with a sense of ceremony picked a few flowers and weeds and arranged them in an old tin can. It made the perfect table decoration.
Then, still blackened-up and filthy from their morning’s labours, they relaxed in the armchairs and got on with the festivities.
The Chioco tea party was not without its security, but it was a leisurely, enjoyable affair, the culmination of the SAS’s domination of the Tete Province.
As the sun filtered through the overhanging tree, the grimy soldiers cocked their little fingers delicately in the air and slowly sipped _Manica_ beer out of their china tea cups.
Soon, the smell of fried chicken mingled with that of the burning, smouldering buildings.
One of the troops found a pet monkey among the rubble and sat it on the table, breaking open a couple of tins of mangoes for the little chap.
Then, with the SAS in complete mastery of the town, their victorious commander stood on the front porch of the mayor’s parlour and officially pronounced himself the new Lord Mayor of Chioco. To a man, they agreed it was an honour well deserved.
Special Branch were choppered in to glean whatever intelligence they could from the mountain of captured documents, and as most of it was in Portuguese, SAS trooper Manny Carvalho got the job of sifting through it.
A huge masonry tower, a monument to the Portuguese era, was found to conceal a massive ammunition cache, much of it ancient weaponry, including Second World War Mausers with German crests. What the SAS couldn’tmake use of themselves, they piled into a giant heap, and come the end of the day, the square-shaped tower was blown up.
Following hard on the heels of the garrison attack, the assault on the town was to serve as the final nail in the coffin for the enemy. The comforts afforded to ZANLA and FRELIMO at Chioco were never to be offered to them again...  for the town and garrison were never rebuilt.
Their celebrations over, the SAS split into two parties to continue harassing and ambushing the enemy. Mac McIntosh and twenty men remained in Chioco and sat on the road day and night to stop ZANLA and their resupplies getting through to Rhodesia ... while the commander and his team went north to Chinhanda Crossroads to stage a few surprises there.
Mac’s stay-behind party remained on the outskirts of the devastated town for several days, but it proved a difficult area to ambush, and they moved back into the ruins, rigged up the mortar, and waited for a FRELIMO reaction party, which they knew wouldn’t be too long in coming.
Although FRELIMO came in strength, only three men had the courage to risk going into the town...  and the SAS watched and waited as they warily moved down the main road, expecting a trap, an ambush ...
There was a sudden crump of mortar fire and one man dropped, the green of his uniform stained blood red. Fortunately for the other two, they were hidden from view by all the rubble, and managed to escape. Not so lucky was the Tanzanian lieutenant who came face to face with an SAS early-warning group that afternoon.
But FRELIMO and their Tanzanian friends were not prepared to allow the SAS to reign supreme in Chioco ... and before long, a combined force of 100 men, supported by mortars, arrived on the outskirts, and for every bomb the SAS fired, they got ten back in reply.
Then a lucky mortar bomb, the only one fired with any accuracy, landed next to the SAS command post, slightly wounding Mac Mcintosh and Corporal Dave Arkwright.
The SAS were big enough to admit that chaos reigned for a short while, but talk of abandoning the town was met with sharp words from the SAS commander in Salisbury.
After the two injured men were casevacked, Captain Bob McKenna came in to take command of the Chioco siege. But there was no more fight left in FRELIMO and their Tanzanian friends...  and a few days later, the SAS finally took their leave of the smouldering ruin that once was Chioco.

Captain Dave Dodson and his team, meanwhile, were sitting it out at Chinhanda Crossroads and having a fair share of success.
They were having one contact after another, and had no sooner cleaned up the road and hidden the bodies behind a hill, than another group of enemy came sauntering along.
A letter found on one body indicated they were part of a larger group from nearby Jeque, and the SAS, RLI and Air Force mounted an immediate airborne attack on the ZANLA camp there. Those fortunate enough to escape ran straight into the path of Dodson and his team sitting waiting for them at Chinhanda Crossroads. Their luck finally ran out - and the SAS’s mound of bodies took on new proportions.
The SAS tidied up the road as best they could and waited for their next victims...
By the end of the week, 24 enemy had been accounted for, the ambushers having been forced to move their position only once.
Having reached the two dozen mark, the commander decided to call it a day and leave the enemy alone for a while. The SAS had spooked them sufficiently, and if they harboured any doubts beforehand, there was a mortuary full of bodies to prove that the Rhodesians most definitely meant business...
All told, it had been a very productive deployment.
