ZANLA had established a fairly strong presence at Chioco garrison, one kilometre south of Chioco town in Tete Province from where they deployed straight into Rhodesia over a very wide area.  
The Rhodesians were determined to do something about the 100 or so enemy based there ... and a decision was made to destroy the place.  
ZANLA had the luxury of a properly-built camp with all the comforts of barrack blocks, electricity and a water tower.  
The garrison had been built by the Tanzanians but they pulled back to Tete and FRELIMO had taken it over. Then their ZANLA comrades had moved in.  
ZANLA were well fortified with an excellent trench and bunker system and could be expected to put up a fight.  
The SAS was to get the task of sorting out the garrison and its occupants, and the mission commander, Captain Dave Dodson, realised that decisive firepower would be crucial to the mission… and every one of the 22 operators from “A” to”B” Troops was told to draw unusually large amounts of ammunition for the job.  
The odds were five to one against the attackers, but they were planning that their extra ammunition and the element of surprise would tip the scales in their favour, enough to rout the enemy, force them to abandon the camp and push them further back to Tete ... and away from the Rhodesian border.  
Having moved out to Mtoko forward air base in preparation for the operation, Corporal Imre Baka, the storeman in charge of the ammunition truck, was kept busy most of the day with ammunition requests.  
As always, security was tight and although lmre Baka was in the SAS, he was not told what the mission was about However, in view of all the ammunition he was issuing it took little imagination to work out that it had to be a large ambush or a camp attack.  
Much frenzied activity went on around the base and the preparations went on until well after sundown.  
Then Sergeant Andy Chait wandered across to see Corporal Baka in the ammunition store to tell him he had been selected for the mortar team. Baka was to get his kit together and be at the briefing at 09h00 next day. For Baka, normally a base soldier, it was a chance in a million.  
Later, Sergeant Iain Bowen visited the amino truck for some claymores. The commander had just returned from a quick aerial reconnaissance of Chioco garrison and brought back photographs showing that there were several buildings made of corrugated iron ... and claymores would be the perfect thing to blow them away.  
The sergeant said he wanted to set up a bank of ten claymores against the walls of the two barrack rooms… and in less than a minute Bowen and Baka had worked out how a wiring harness could be used to blow the two groups of claymores simultaneously. After an hour of scrounging, they had a harness made up that could be put in place and ready for action in a very short time.  
The harness was wound on to a cardboard reel… and they made a few dry runs to see how long it would take to set up.  
At the briefing next morning, a small model of Chioco terror base was on display. Ration boxes substituted for buildings and were labelled with what type of construction they were made of. Prominent terrain features - hills, bunkers and trenches were also depicted.  
Then the commander gave a thorough briefing, designating which callsigns would go in first and their positions in the assault...  how many enemy they could expect... the types of weapons at the camp and where they were positioned. There was a 75 millimetre recoilless rifle near Chioco police station and they would be taking in a 60 millimetre mortar to counter it.  
Then they moved off to a remote part of the airfield for a few dry runs of the camp attack, just to ensure everyone knew his job.  
After lunch, they left for the long overland trek to Marymount, a former mission, close to the border where the police had a base camp. They helped each other cover up with Black-Is-Beautiful, and within minutes were transformed into Africans.  
The first lift boarded the choppers...  the rotor blades bit into the air...  and they were off for Mozambique once more. The Alouettes shook in protest as they struggled towards the top of the escarpment.  
The three choppers were flying in V-formation and, as they cleared the crest immediately dropped out of sight to keep them off the skyline - and out of enemy sights - as much as possible.  
The whole panorama of the Zambezi Valley lay below them in the distance, the dark green ribbon of the Ruya River rushing up to join the Mazoe, then on to join the Zambezi.  
Eventually, the choppers banked sharply to the left and dropped down to the bush, the rotor blades making the waist-high grass dance like giant waves at sea.  
There was not a single place to put them down and the choppers hovered while the soldiers made a jump for it. Then having dropped the troops some 17 kilometres (11 miles) west of their target, the choppers returned to Marymount to bring in the remainder of the team.  
As the second lift came in, the new arrivals could just make out the shapes of the other SAS men in the treeline where they were in all-round defence.  
The newcomers joined the others in the defensive circle with their weapons at the ready. Soon the noise from the choppers faded into the distance and the bush became quiet again.  
Everyone was straining his eyes and ears to detect some movement, sound, or smell.  
The call of a hornbill broke the silence and a slight breeze started to move through the bush.  
The commander motioned the callsign commanders to gather around him. They were to march a kilometre or so until they found some good cover where they could hide until the moon came up.  
The going was difficult and their equipment heavy, but they soon reached the cover of thick bushes. After posting sentries, the others propped themselves up against their packs and were asleep almost immediately. Yet such was the nature of their work, that the slightest sound or movement, or even a thought, would have them awake in an instant if the need arose.  
All too soon, Sergeant Andy Chait was coming around and whispering to them that it was time to get going. The word was passed back along the line and. by the light of the full moon, the SAS moved off again through the bush ... snaking their way up and down around hills, through dry river beds and in and out of the dense bush.  
They all carried mortar bombs and their equipment seemed to treble in weight, the straps of their packs cutting into their shoulders. They walked for fifty minutes then rested for ten ... then were on the march again.  
They walked all that night by the light of the moon and, at the first signs of morning moved into the cover of the thick bush. Everyone cleared a space for himself, removing crackling twigs and noisy leaves before promptly passing out from exhaustion, all that is, except the usual sentry who would get his turn later.  
That afternoon, Captain Dodson called the other callsign commanders together - Andy Chait, Iain Bowen and Nick Breytenbach - to give them their final briefing... and, that night they were back on their travels again.  
At about 23h00, they came out of the bush and on to a footpath and walked down each side of it en route to Chioco, a stone’s throw from their target, Chioco garrison.  
Twenty minutes later, the unmistakable sound of African music and singing floated across the still night from the direction of the town ... and the whole line ground to a halt.  
It was coming from a radio or record player in Chioco. There were voices raised in song and it clearly told them that one hell of a party was in progress.  
They moved off through the night again ... and very soon an airfield with fuel drums scattered over it, the outline of buildings and a water tower loomed into view. Next to the buildings, they saw the glow of a couple of campfires. There could be no mistaking this for anything but the target.  
They stopped once more and the commander told the mortar team to follow him. A sergeant, and a corporal obeyed the command and Corporal lmre Baka fell in behind them ... they turned off the path into a maize field that was between the camp and the path.  
Dodson had selected this as an ideal spot for the 60 millimetre mortar, it would not be seen from the camp and the mortar team would have a clear field of fire with no big trees impairing the upward flight of bombs. Their role was to mortar Chioco town one kilometre from the garrison and more particularly, the police station, just to keep their heads down and out of the fracas, while the rest of the SAS attacked the camp itself.  
Everyone dropped off his Bergen and mortar bombs at the mortar position and walked off through the bush ... then Dave Dodson. Andy Chait, Iain Bowen and Nick Breytenbach, the four callsign commanders, moved 500 metres south of the fenced camp to do their final reconnaissance.  
Turning to Nick Breytenbach. the commander whispered that he wanted him to take his callsign to the northern corner of the camp, The idea was that once the attack went in, the other three callsigns would drive the terrorists towards him.  
“Sir, is there going to be another callsign next to me?” Nick enquired, remembering his briefing that there were 100 enemy in the garrison.  
“No.” came the reply, “only the four of you …”  
H-hour was to be at first light on March 24. The plan called for Nick to set off his eight claymores on the northern corner at the same time Sergeant Iain Bowen detonated the claymores against the two barrack room walls on the west of the camp. Nick and Iain synchronised their watches to ensure the plan went smoothly.  
Immediately the claymores went off. Frank Booth, Nick’s second-in-command, was to throw two high explosive hand grenades into an enemy-occupied bunker inside the camp.  
The exploding claymores would be the signal for the three assault teams to move through the sleeping camp - Iain Bowen was to take the left side; Dave Dodson, commanding the main assault team would move through the centre...  and Andy Chait and his team would be on the fight. And any interference from the town was to be dealt with by the mortar team.  
A couple of hours before the attack was due to go in, Nick and his team headed around to the left of the camp and up through open bush, crossed over the main road to Chioco town, and eased in to their position on the northern corner of the garrison.  
Nick and his 21C did their final recce. They could hear two terrorists snoring and pointed some of the claymores towards them; then positioned the remainder fight up against the corrugated iron buildings.  
Nick showed Frank Booth where he had to throw his grenades: then they settled down to await first light.  
The other three callsigns meanwhile were slowly easing forward across the dirt track and crouched on the outside of the fence.  
Corporal Baka was busying himself with the mortar when Sergeant Chait came over and asked him if he would like to be in his assault group. One of his troopers had a slight cough and had to be replaced, Andy expIained. Baka again jumped at the chance. The man he was to replace could do all the coughing he wanted while dropping bombs into the mortar. Leaving the coughing trooper to nursemaid the mortar, he followed Andy.  
Andy’s callsign was already in position behind the wire fence, and Andy and Baka slithered under the three-strand fence and crawled up a slight rise. The sergeant told him who was on his left and right, wished him good luck and moved off to take up his own position.  
Below them, the camp was quiet. There were no lights on and the music and singing in the town had stopped some time before.  
All that separated the SAS assault team and 100 enemy were a few blades of grass. It was a fairly cool morning and they lay low in the wet dew trying not to think what could go wrong hoping no one saw them.  
Just before first light, Dave Dodson’s and Iain Bowen’s teams forming the main assault group, crawled under the fence through a gap between two trenches and placed their claymores along the walls of the two barrack rooms.  
Then they discovered that instead of both buildings being made of tin, one of them - the one allocated to the commander and his callsign - was of brick.  
Swiftly, they set about positioning the claymores, placing one down, unravelling the wire from the cardboard reel placing another, then running out another...  soon, there were five in position along the back of each barrack block.  
The eastern sky began to get lighter.  
There was a flicker of light in one of the barrack block windows, then a faint glow of a cigarette as a man took a long pull on it. The glow disappeared, then appeared at the next window, then the next, moving closer to the door at the end of the building.  
Outside, Iain Bowen had just put the last claymore down and was unravelling the wire to take it back to the detonation position.  
Suddenly, the door opened and a naked black man with a cigarette dangling from his lips sauntered out of the building and proceeded to urinate just one metre from the SAS man.  
Iain gripped his rifle and hardly dared breathe. The urine splashed on to the concrete steps of the barrack block...  but the dozy terrorist did not see the Rhodesian soldier lurking in the gloom of the coming morning.  
When he finished, he shook the last few drops, cleared his throat and spat with feeling into the dust, then turned and sauntered back into the building, Iain watched the glow of his cigarette and followed the man’s progress as he made his way back to the window where he had first lit up his cigarette.  
Iain hurried back to the overgrown trench system, crawled under the fence. Checked that the circuit lights on the Shrike exploder connecting the claymores were working. For if there was a short, the claymores would not work. He was relieved to find that everything was in order.  
It was 04h30 - another thirty minutes before the fireworks. They all settled down now to await first light.  
The adrenalin was racing as it always did before an attack, each man thinking of his role in the forthcoming action.  
Despite the trenches and bunkers the enemy obviously felt very safe in their garrison camp ... the unmanned weapons positions and the totally unprotected high ground would soon be evidence of that.  
In the north, Frank Booth began to sneak up to the bunker with his two high explosive grenades. He pulled out the pins, held down the levers and with a grenade in each hand, waited patiently for the claymores to go off.  
As one long minute followed another, he knew he could not possibly relax his grip on the grenades. To do so, would send the levers flying, and if he wanted to live, he would have to throw them. And he did not want to do that, until the time was right... until the claymores went off.  
Fifteen minutes later, exactly at the pre-arranged time, the commander gave the order for the attack to go in.  
Immediately, an ear-shattering explosion broke the silence as Nick Breytenbach set off his claymores on the north ... followed a couple of seconds later by those against Iain Bowen’s and the commander’s barrack blocks. Bowen and Dodson had waited just long enough for the terrorists to sit and stand up in the barrack blocks, thus making them better targets.  
The claymores did little damage to the commander’s masonry barrack block, but they certainly knocked the stuffing out of Iain Bowen’s.  
A split second later, Frank Booth had tossed his gift of two grenades into the bunker...  then ran back to take up his position in Nick Breytenbach’s callsign in the north. Two muffied explosions added to the commotion as the grenades did their job.  
Immediately everyone in the main assault group got to his feet and started moving forward. The SAS advanced at a walk and the green tracers of their AKs and RPDs were interlacing with the red tracers of their FNs.  
Andy Chait’s callsign was moving parallel with the main assault line but firing across their line of sight, thus catching the terrorists in an L-shaped assault and forcing them either to fight or die or take off towards Chioco.  
The din of the smallarms fire was punctuated by the explosions of RPGs and grenades.  
Iain Bowen put a rocket into his building to blow a hole in it, then fired low through the outer wall, spraying the floor with rounds, trying to catch any enemy lying low in the building.  
They fired a magazine each, then firing slackened off as they did a quick reload and went in.  
Sergeant Bowen paused for a second at his barrack room door to check that all the men had reloaded. They had, and he ran in to see a terrorist trying to escape through a window.  
Two shots in quick succession rang out and the man fell dead, shot in the rear with a double tap from Iain Bowen’s FN. By now the rest of his callsign had joined him and were sweeping through the building, firing under the beds, behind Chaits, anywhere the enemy was likely to be hiding.  
The room turned out to be somewhat deserted, as many of the ZANLA men had already made good their escape and others had gone to the party in the town that night.  
Everywhere there was devastation. The claymores, the rocket and the blistering deafening weight of fire as the troops swept through had left the walls holed and pockmarked and the few personal effects ZANLA had were in complete disarray.  
Near the main entrance to the camp and twenty metres from Sergeant Bowen’s barrack room was a sentry position, and by now the two duty guards were returning fire.  
Iain Bowen and team, having finished with the barrack block, opened up on them and the two guards suddenly lost all enthusiasm for the fight as they went clean through the side of their guard house in their haste to be gone. The whole side of the guard house was torn out in the process...  and the two Africans dashed off up the road practically carrying it with them ... and followed by a stream of angry tracers.  
The remains of the building clattered down into the dust  
To the north, Nick Breytenbach was reeling in the wires of his claymores and putting them in his pack. Suddenly, he looked up to see the terrorists right on top of him and tripping over the wire he had laid out for the claymores. Some were jumping past and over him. Some had nothing on: others wore just underpants; others sported only chest webbing, some had no weapons at all ...  
Immediately, the northern stop group sprang into action and began to have a field day picking off the fleeing ZANLA. One fell fatally wounded on top of one of the troopies.  
The trench system was such that the terrorists could hop into the trenches inside the camp and move to the outside of the fence without being seen. The trenches ended a couple of paces away from Nick’s left-hand side and he could clearly hear a couple of them talking against the background of firing.  
Nick, who spoke fluent Shona, heard them say that this surely was the day they were going to die.  
“These maningis (bad whites) here are going to slaughter us,” one said to his companion.  
By now the commander and his team had cleared their barrack block and were turning their attentions to the trench system and tossing in bunker bombs.  
The advancing assault groups were getting return fire from the bunker on the other side of the camp. They could actually see the grey streaks of the bullets coming at them as they moved forward shooting.  
As one thought after another tumbled through their minds, they couldn’t hear their own weapons firing as they advanced, and it only registered that they themselves were firing when they saw their empty cartridge cases spewing out...  and now and then saw their tracers burning.  
The crescendo of return fire was so intense that the men in the mortar position were convinced the SAS had run into a battalion of enemy and been overwhelmed. They could see huge quantities of red and green tracer rising into the air all around the garrison. It was a spectacular sight.  
Andy Chait’s group on the right-hand side of the camp were now dealing with the trenches. Several enemy tried to jump out and make a run for it. Those who did were no match for one corporal and his RPD. The earth erupted around them and they collapsed like rag dolls.  
The steady crump of the SAS mortar could be heard above the rifle fire and exploding bunker bombs and it was followed almost immediately by the corresponding explosions as the bombs landed in Chioco town.  
Sergeant Chait yelled for his team to sweep towards the water tower. A corporal opened up with his RPD and the others followed suit. In less than a couple of seconds the water tank resembled a sieve and the water poured out like a giant shower.  
The commander’s team meanwhile were sorting out a troublesome RPD gunner in the garrison’s command building on the corner of the parade square...  while Iain Bowen’s team moved down to a bunker.  
The armoury went up with a fairly big whoosh as the thatched roof caught fire.  
In the north, despite one man’s weapon having a gas stoppage and another a malfunction, the bodies were piling up around the SAS as their colleagues elsewhere in the camp drove the enemy towards them.  
![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
Andy Chait’s advance was blocked by a deep gully, but there was a makeshift bridge made from a few planks of wood. and Andy told his men to cross over one at a time.  
At the other side of the bridge, a lone terrorist came running out of a partially concealed two-storeyed house - a strangely-out-of-place building with red bricks and white window shutters.  
The man had no intention of dying without a fight and dropped to one knee and brought his AK to his shoulder. He was killed immediately.  
The din tapered off and Andy Chait indicated to his men that he wanted them to wheel to t he left. They moved away from the house, crossed a narrow field, scrambled up a three-metre-high dirt mound and came out on to a maize field.  
From the top of the mound they raked the field, their tracers ricocheting and arching into the sky.  
Cautiously, they moved out between the maize stalks. Five metres from the edge of the field someone fired at them. They hit the dirt. But luckily the terrorists were aiming high and the rounds cracked over their heads.  
To their front was a trench and they saw the muzzle flashes of terrorists intent on killing them. Everyone sent a blistering rate of rounds towards the trench and some threw grenades.  
Andy shouted to Imre Baka to throw a white phosphorus grenade. Baka pulled the pin and threw it. shouting _“white phos”_ as he did so. As the cannister arched towards the trench, he knew it would be on target.  
It exploded in the trench like a firework display. The white smoke billowed out.  
obscuring their vision. There were several more explosions and more white smoke.  
The firing from the trench stopped. The agonising screams of the injured enemy filled the air as the white phosphorus burnt into their bodies. Those lucky enough not to be hit, fled - straight into the path of the commander’s callsign. Their luck finally ran out and they too died.  
By now the maize field was on fire, set alight by the terrorists’ tracers or some of the white phosphorus...  and Andy Chait and his team were forced to move away.  
The trench still had to be cleared and they poured automatic rifle fire along the whole length of it. They heard no more from the enemy.  
Andy Chait and his team were to remain in their position until the main assault group finished the sweep.  
Firing broke out to their front, about fifty metres away. A steady stream of tracers were climbing into the sky from the bottom of a large anthill which formed part of the trench system. It looked as if someone down in the trench was firing an RPD through the opening. Everyone opened up at where he thought the trouble was coming from.  
Andy shouted across to Imre Baka to give him a hand grenade. Imre tossed him one. Andy put his AK down and was just about to pull the pin and sort out the gunner, when the earth erupted around them.  
Bullets were hitting the ground. Someone saw a terrorist stick his rifle out of the trench and take pot shots.  
Baka looked at Andy for direction; then heard a loud slap and saw Andy’s denims tear open on the outside of his right thigh.  
Andy yelled that he was hit, grabbed his thigh above the wound and rolled into the trench. The grenade rolled in with him. The terrorist responsible was also in the trench and had to be killed before anyone could get to Andy.  
Andy, still holding his thigh, called the commander over and said his injury was a bad one; they had got the artery.  
He was lifted out to the edge of the trench, but because his colleagues had to kill the terrorist first, they lost a precious thirty seconds before the medic could put on a tourniquet  
Baka recovered the grenade, pulled the pin and threw it at the anthill. The firing coming from there ceased.  
Quickly, the operators picked up Andy and moved him to a safer position in cover behind one of the buildings. Someone ran to fetch a bed to try to make him comfortable.  
When Iain Bowen, busy finishing off clearing the bunker, realised what had happened to Andy, he immediately sent his medic to help...  and he sprinted across the parade ground with bullets bouncing all around him.  
The whoosing sounds of enemy 75 millimetre recoilless rifle rounds were passing over their heads as they helped care for Andy... then 60 millimetre mortar bombs sped from the opposite direction as the SAS mortar replied.  
By now four men had carried Andy towards the landing zone next to the mortar position. The casevac chopper had been sent for...  and it was time to make tracks. The commander had already called for the Hunters to put in an airstrike on Chioco if there was any trouble during uplift  
Nick Breytenbach counted 25 bodies piled around his position. Another 13 lay dead around the trenches and the camp. Later intelligence told that many more were wounded. The shindig in the town that night had undoubtedly saved many ZANLA who had been partying instead of defending their barracks.  
FRELIMO were still firing at them from the town but their firing was becoming more erratic.  
By now the whole garrison was ablaze. There was not much left to fire at in the camp at all. The debris of the battle could be seen in open areas...  buildings were burning and demolished, dead enemy lay strewn in the open and at the bottom of trenches. The SAS knew the smoke of the battle would be visible for miles around.  
![137 - chioco](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Maps/137%20-%20chioco.png)  
It was a helluva sight and they wished they had brought their cameras.  
Some of Andy Chait’s callsign were standing around what had once been the parade square. In the middle was the flagpole with a FRELIMO flag fluttering in the early-morning breeze. A trooper walked over, cut the rope and the flag came floating down. It would make a great decoration for the troopies mess, they all agreed.  
Then a chopper came in and they loaded Andy aboard. By now the low moan of the Hunters could be heard as they sped across the upper skies, poised to put in a strike on FRELIMO reaction troops. But there was no trouble and the uplift went off smoothly.  
The troops gathered up their kit and began marching back to Rhodesia, to be picked up on the way by the choppers. They had gone only a few kilometres when a message crackled over their radio. It was bad news: Andy had died on the way home.  
The medic had managed to keep him alive for an hour, but it had been to no avail.  
Soon the welcoming repetitive thump of the Alouette rotor blades told that their mission was almost over. The commander threw an orange smoke grenade to orientate the choppers, and within minutes they had touched down.  
Nick Breytenbach, the last passenger in his helicopter, handed in his pack, radio and rifle to his colleagues. Then, as he put his foot on the step, the chopper suddenly lifted.  
Somehow, he managed to grab on to the step and was whisked up into the air. But he couldn’t get into the chopper and fell to earth with a thud.  
He looked around and saw the smoke still hanging in the air from the grenade the commander had thrown to attract the attention of the choppers. There was no one else there - and the choppers bearing his colleagues home were getting smaller and smaller.  
The adrenalin began pumping again as Nick considered his chances, left totally alone in a hostile environment, shortly after a successful camp attack on an enemy garrison!  
“This is it _Nickers_.” he thought to himself. “You’ve had your day.”  
Then, suddenly, he saw one of the choppers getting bigger, then it touched down. The pilot mumbled an apology; said he had been convinced Nick was on board...  then they lifted off over the treetops and set course for home.  
As they headed back for the border, they knew they had done their work well. It had been a well-planned and well-executed operation. And it had been one of their most exciting missions, too.  
But the price of victory had been high. They had lost Andy Chait, an utterly fearless soldier, whose aggressiveness and courage were admired by all. Andy was a model soldier and many tried to emulate him. He was awarded a posthumous Member of the Legion of Merit for his distinguished service to the SAS and Rhodesia.  
Nick Breytenbach received the Military Forces Commendation for the part he and his team played in the attack, as did a very brave Acting Corporal Frank Booth, who sat for an unbelievably long 15 minutes with a high explosive grenade in each hand waiting to throw them into the bunker.  
As for the garrison, it was never the same, and was never reoccupied by the enemy.  
It would not be the last Chioco saw of the SAS either...
