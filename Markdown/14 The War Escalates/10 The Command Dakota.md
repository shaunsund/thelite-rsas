After the successful raids on Chimoio and Tembue, the airborne method of command was developed further.  
While the army and air force commanders favoured the helicopter method of command as it allowed them to be more involved in the battle, helicopters were particularly vulnerable… it was necessary to leave the battle from time-to-time to refuel ... and it was also tying up a valuable helicopter that could be used on another task.  
 It was finally decided that the total command of a battle should take place from a command Dakota, but that as a back-up, there should also be an alternative or subordinate command element. Sometimes a chopper was used, occasionally, a Lynx.  
A high frequency command radio and radio plugs and teleprinter were installed in the command Dakota, special mapboards with photo-overlay facilities were built in and the seats turned around so that the army and air force commanders could face each other.
