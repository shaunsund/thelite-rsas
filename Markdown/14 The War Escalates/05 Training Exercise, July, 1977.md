For Captain Colin Willis, attached to the School of Infantry in Gwelo, it seemed as if the war was passing him by.  
He had done his initial recruit training in the SAS way back in 1970 and was within a week of doing his parachute course and joining a troop, when he decided his career might take off better if he were an officer. He was duly selected for the officer cadet selection course, passing out 13 months later at the School of Infantry, third in order of merit.  
But that did not mean he could go back to his parent unit, the SAS, as an officer.  
For the unit insisted that SAS officers - other than a few experienced senior NCOs already in the unit who had undergone officer-training - serve at least two years in a conventional unit before joining the SAS... and as a result of that ruling, Colin was posted to the RLI where he stayed for four years, earning the Bronze Cross for gallantry and leadership in action in the process.  
Then he went back to the School of Infantry, this time as an officer instructor, which was an ideal posting and another step up the ladder for a career officer.  
But it was now mid-1977, the war had begun to escalate, and Colin, like most soldiers, wanted a hit of the action. He knew that if he stayed where he was, his next move would he the inevitable, but mundane, posting to Army Headquarters as a staff officer. It would mean more responsibility, more money, more office routine - but no action.  
On the other hand, if he joined the SAS ...  
Colin sought an interview with SAS OC Brian Robinson. Fortunately, Brian was equally keen for Colin to “return” to the unit, but told him that he would have to do another selection course, it was not going to deter Colin, but he was surprised that having already done one selection course with the SAS the unit wanted him to do _another_.  
The SAS, however, had definite ideas about “outside” officers wanting to join its ranks. No matter what their background, experience or previous training, they had to undergo the stringent selection phase to assess their leadership potential and their ability to command SAS troops in the more unconventional SAS operations.  
And if the normal selection course for ordinary SAS soldiers was tough, the officers course was designed to be even more arduous.  
The customary gruelling long-distance march with heavy loads was the great leveller, bringing everyone - officer, raw recruit and men from other units - down to the same physical state of fitness. But then Colin and the other two officers along on the same selection phase, soon found that in addition, they, as officers, were expected to write military appreciations and make plans and decisions whilst totally worn out from the most strenuous of conditions.  
SAS training officer Captain Rob Johnstone and his team were particularly interested in making the training phase as realistic as possible. To this end the three officers were assembled and tasked to carry out a reconnaissance, as an undercover group, on the central ammunition depot at Lleweilin Barracks in Bulawayo, which housed supplies for the whole of Matabeleland and the Midlands.  
A couple of days later, the three officers, blackened-up, dressed as African labourers, and carrying grass-slashers sauntered casually up to the perimeter fence of the central ammunition depot.  
In Rhodesia, Africans working on the side of a road seldom warranted a second glance and no one, least of all the white security guards on duty, paid the slightest attention to these particular chaps as they kept to the bushes and scythed through the long grass with their slashers.  
They were back again the next day, studying the depot from all angles and assessing the security situation. Then, their reconnaissance over, they returned to Salisbury, where they worked out their written military appreciations on how they would get in and out of the depot… and then, working from a model, they had to give orders on how they proposed to destroy the target.  
Colin was very impressed with the way things were going.  
In all his years in the army, this was the first time that full operational verbal orders were given with models and all the other paraphernalia that the School of Infantry taught officers they would get to use in their units, and which Colin knew seldom happened. He would soon find that this was the norm in planning SAS operations.  
After a further 24-hour gruelling phase to test fitness, training officer Rob Johnstone addressed the students:  
“Right, you’ve done the recce. Now - go and attack the place ... “  
One of the three officers was tasked to command the mission but the man felt he could not handle the job - and by his admission, ruled out all chances of a career in the SAS. It was then that Colin found himself in charge. Now, all the theory and the time spent in the classroom was to be put to the test.  
It was the height of the war and the central ammunition depot, which would make an ideal target for terrorists, was surrounded by a wire fence and patrolled by twenty European guards who kept watch from a series of towers. The substantial floodlighting all around the depot would not make the SAS candidates’ job any easier.  
Colin and his team knew they would have to be good. If they were not, they knew they would not pass selection. It was as simple as that.  
The SAS training officer took the precaution of tipping off the commandant of Llewellin Barracks as well as the officer who would be on duty on the night of the attack. The base armourer was also asked to remove the firing pins from the guards’ weapons.  
In the interests of realism, however, the guards were not informed of the plan.  
A few days later, for the second time, blackened-up men approached the arms depot. This time they came by night came in strength and were dressed in an assortment of khaki uniforms. They took cover in a blind spot between two arc lights, then crept up to the security fence. They were now right beneath two of the watch towers.  
They waited for a few seconds, then, certain that no one had seen them, cut an entrance through the wire. The two officers, Colin Willis and Mac McIntosh, slowly inched their way into the depot.  
The two men silently made their way to the main guard building, ready to take on the duty guard outside. But there was no one in sight. The mission was getting easier by the minute.  
Meanwhile, the unsuspecting guard commander, his 2IC and the relief guards were gathered in the building waiting to take their turn in the watch towers later than night.  
Suddenly, the door burst open and two “black” men dressed in khaki terrorist gear stormed in, their silenced weapons bristling and pointing straight at the twenty assembled men.  
The element of surprise was total and the look on the guards’ faces was a picture. The startled guards had no time to react and only one of the twenty men lounging around tried to reach for his rifle.  
The duty NCO sat with his feet up on his desk. His cap was pulled over his eyes and he was fast asleep. One of the unexpected visitors gave him a good hard kick in just the right place. He flew up and the befuddled look on his face disclosed he had not the least idea what was going on around him.  
The trembling guards, firmly convinced that the late-night intruders were ZIPRA, were bundled into a small armoury and locked up. The main gate was opened and the remainder of the SAS selection course poured through to assume their respective roles in the attack on the depot.  
Meanwhile, Colin Willis and Mac McIntosh had persuaded the watch commander to accompany them to each of the watch towers, the barrel of an Uzi that was firmly stuck in his ear playing no small part in his willingness to help.  
Without too much prompting, the watch commander called seven of his eight guards down from their towers, and the eighth one, asleep in the grass nearby, was duly rounded up.  
The commander and all his guards were tied to one of the towers, then they watched helplessly as Colin and his team quickly moved through the night securing the depot. But there were no deafening explosions and no killings and the petrified guards soon realised that the visitors were not ZIPRA after all.  
But it had been amply demonstrated that had they been the enemy, they would have no problem destroying everyone and everything in the depot. The exercise had not only tested the ability of the raiders but shown up the sorry state of security at the vital installation.  
The depot commandant was not amused by the 400 Rhodesian dollars worth of damage inflicted on the fence but was impressed enough to order a major tightening of security at the installation.  
The guards were not enchanted with the SAS either and some were to spend a few uncomfortable days in the stocks for neglecting their duties that night.  
Colin Willis and the other students passed selection ... and thereafter, whenever the word got around that the SAS was visiting Llewellin Barracks, even the Regimental Police at the gate who normally carried only sidearms or no weapons at all, were armed - and very much on the alert.  
￼![Scene Change](https://gitlab.sund.org/tomes/TheElite_RSAS/raw/master/Images/Scene%20Change.png)  
Combined Operations Headquarters housed in Milton Buildings in the heart of Salisbury was the nerve centre of the Rhodesian war machine and as such was the most important building in the land.  
And no one could get past or outfox the security people there, the Prime Minister’s personal security officer boasted to SAS 21C Major Mick Graham.  
Despite Mick’s assurances that the SAS was perhaps the one unit that could do it, the man remained adamant. Security was so good, he claimed, that not _even_ the SAS could pull it off.  
Ever one to rise to a challenge, Mick knew what had to be done. The unit with the Who Dares Wins tradition was not about to be written off by a bunch of security guards. At least, not without a fight.  
Shortly afterwards, Captain Colin Willis, recently back in town from a bush trip, found himself tasked with getting into ComOps.  
Colin knew that this particular exercise was not only going to be a fair test on ComOps security, but, as he would be working alone, it would also be a fairly stringent test of his own abilities and initiative.  
He had never been to ComOps before and knew only that General Peter Walls and the Prime Minister worked in the building.  
A few days later, Colin sprinted up the steps that lead to the hallowed corridors of Milton Buildings. He was dressed in civilian clothing and carried a briefcase packed with plastic explosives. It was with some trepidation that he approached the security guards’ post  
“Morning.” he said to the two guards on duty. in a crisp, businesslike tone that served to hide his nervousness.  
“I’ve come to see Mr Mitchell in the PM’s Department. He’s expecting me,” he continued, omitting to give his own name or say where he had come from.  
“Fine, sir.” said the guard, in an equally businesslike manner. “Just fill this in first.”  
The guard pushed a roneoed questionnaire across the desk to Colin and the SAS officer was deliberately vague about the details he gave and simply signed in as “Mr Williams”.  
Satisfied with the visitor’s particulars, or rather the lack of them, the guard accompanied him up the stairs to the first floor. Colin somehow managed to walk in front, and then with an authoritative nod of his head, he dismissed the guard telling him that he knew the way.  
The security man took his word and disappeared down the steps to take up his post by the entrance once more, while Colin, still with his explosives by his side, took off along the corridors of the Prime Minister’s Department as if he owned the place.  
Then he wandered around the first floor until a civil servant approached. Colin got him to point the way to the ComOps Department and when the man headed off for his office, Colin darted in to the nearest gents’ toilet and sat himself down in the first cubicle.  
So far, so good. Quite frankly, he told himself, he couldn’t believe his good luck. As far as he knew, there was no one working in the Prime Minister’s Department by the name of Mitchell. That, as they say in army circles, had been sheer bulldust on his part.  
The guards had not bothered to ask for his ID or check out his suitcase. So much for the tight security, he thought. Still, he knew that he wasn’t out of the woods yet.  
Although it was his first visit to ComOps, he was known by some of the hierarchy as an SAS officer and he knew if they saw him wandering around, they would get suspicious.  
He initially decided to stay in the toilet all day until most people had gone home, then, once the coast was clear, he would come out and get into ComOps. But then he remembered he had signed in. If security was what it really ought to be, they would notice he had not signed out and might even mount a search for him. He decided to return that night when things had quietened down a bit.  
When the corridor was clear, Colin retraced his steps and with a brisk. “Cheerio” and a friendly wave to the guards at the door, he left Milton Buildings - for the time being.  
Back home, he set about preparing his suitcase for his return visit. Inside went 10 kilograms of plastic explosive, Cordtex detonators, a timing device, a saw and other bits and pieces of sabotage equipment.  
Then, at 19h00, when all the civil servants had left for the day and there was only a skeleton staff on duty, Colin once again approached Milton Buildings.  
This time, there were new faces on the security desk but Colin had come prepared with a better cover story, and felt more confident than on his first visit. Still in civilian clothes and packing a pistol in a concealed holster, he flashed a card with a picture of a helicopter on it.  
It was a Viet Nam War Veteran’s identity card borrowed for the occasion from SAS captain, American Bob McKenna. It bore Bob’s name too, but the guards did not seem to notice, as nothing was said when the visitor signed himself in as Capt M.U. Gabe, a name not dissimilar to that of the ZANLA leader!  
Colin informed the guards that he was going up to ComOps, and before they had time to strike up a conversation, he was on his way up the stairs, plus suitcase.  
There was no one to be seen in the corridors and he was soon outside the ComOps door. There were security bars on the windows but he decided not to try sawing them immediately.  
Experience often proved that the simplest solutions were best. And so it turned out to be on this occasion. He turned the handle and the door opened. The amazed captain stepped into a small waiting area, and luckier still there was no one around to bar his entry.  
There was another door in the waiting room, which Colin assumed could only lead into the ComOps inner sanctum. But it had no handle, which meant it probably operated on some form of timing device from the inside.  
Now he had a problem. He had not anticipated this sort of hurdle. He was just contemplating what to do next, when he heard footsteps approaching down the corridor.  
Quickly, the SAS captain clambered under the only desk in the waiting room. His heart was making a terrible racket, and it flashed through his mind that it might give him away.  
An Army officer entered the room and walked straight over to the desk, The SAS captain crouched lower and thought that his little game was up before it had got started.  
The ComOps man put his hand over the desk and reached underneath. His hand was dangerously close to Colin’s head. Then, he pressed a little button concealed under the desk top, and with a _bzzz_ the inner door magically swung open.  
Colin was delighted. His dilemma had been solved for him… and he watched the man go through the door and saw it close shut behind him.  
As soon as he thought it safe, Colin pressed the same button and as the door opened once again, he scrambled out from under the desk. hurriedly brushed his clothes down and walked cautiously through the door.  
There was not a soul to be seen ... and for the next ninety minutes, Colin pussyfooted around ComOps laying dummy-charges using real plastic explosives but without the detonators.  
He got into General Walls’s outer office without anyone disturbing him and did the same in the police representative’s office, which was littered with maps showing ZANLA’s main deployment routes into Rhodesia. Just to prove how abysmal the security was, Colin collected them up and bundled them into his briefcase.  
A beautiful silver letter opener gracing the police officer’s desk caught his eye and that too, was stashed into his briefcase together with bits and pieces of other booty from the desk.  
He also spread his charges around the office of the Head of Psychological Operations. That ought to give him something to think about.  
He located the duty officer’s room and found the man’s beret and briefcase lying on the bed where he was going to sleep that night Colin stole the man’s pistol and put plastic explosive under his beret.  
He pseudo booby-trapped the ComOps ammunition store - and no one came near him or into the office the whole time. It couldn’t have been simpler.  
His mission complete, Colin left Milton Buildings, and with a rather confident “Night, then” to the smiling guards on duty at the main entrance, he waved goodbye.  
Next day, there was much consternation at ComOpe when the staff realised that their bastion had been penetrated and there were a couple of things missing.  
They were not to get their chattels back… for the victorious SAS captain had presented his trophies to the SAS Corporals’ Mess long before the hue and cry had erupted.  
The maps were returned and the pistol was handed back to a very annoyed and embarrased duty officer.  
Colin subsequently spent a couple of sessions with the Prime Minister’s security chief, explaining just how easy it had all been.  
Colin’s exercise had certainly exposed the vulnerability of the most important building in the land and it was readily conceded that security left much to be desired.  
As Colin pointed out, there was every reason to believe that had he been a terrorist he could have got into the Prime Minister’s office and eliminated him.  
For the ComOps staff who had taken time off to attend a farewell party in another office that night, it had been a lesson well learned.  
Needless to say, a couple of security guards got their marching orders and the security arrangements were speedily re-organised and improved.  
And SAS officers would soon find that whenever they reported to the ComOps security desk in future, they were _always_ escorted everywhere they went!
