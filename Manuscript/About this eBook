This eBook was made from an old, out-of-print copy of The Elite: The Story of the Rhodesian Special Air Service by Barbara Cole.

This conversion to an eBook format was done to preserve a copy of this book in electronic format similar in purpose to Google’s scanning of books – all to make books, obscure and out-of-print as this one, available online.

In scanning the text and some formatting, have been made. In rare occasions, ‘corrections’ from British English to American English have been accidentally made.

Additionally, this book has a story of courageous men that should not be forgotten along with a lesson: keep fighting to the end, otherwise you will lose your country.
