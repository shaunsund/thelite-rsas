Operation Bouncer

The Rhodesian public had long been conditioned to judging the success of external operations by the number of kills achieved, and this was understandable as the mission given for the initial attacks was to "kill or capture the maximum number of terrorists."
But later, the planners changed this to a multiple mission where they hoped to: prevent enemy locations from functioning as bases.., kill or capture the enemy hierarchy; or capture or destroy enemy weapons and logistical supplies.., kill or capture the maximum number of terrorists and gain intelligence.
While the Selous Scouts were able to capture Elliot Sibanda, The Black Swine ZANLA's top men fared much better, managing to escape all Rhodesian attempts to waylay and account for them.
For months, special forces working externally on Operation Bouncer ops as they were known, sat in wait for vehicles driven by the ZANLA hierarchy. A number of vehicles Were ambushed and a few Russians accounted for- and ZANLA's lucky streak continued, although it was certainly not for want of trying on the Rhodesians" part.
On two occasions, small SAS teams infiltrated into the heart of the Mozambic:~n capital, Maputo, in a bid to eliminate the hierarchy. But on both occasions, the operators had no choice but to return home without the mission having been accomplished. For the ZANLA hierarchy had been tipped off too, although unlike ZIPRA, the ZANLA brass had taken the precaution of evacuating every single member of their staff before the Rhodesians arrived.
